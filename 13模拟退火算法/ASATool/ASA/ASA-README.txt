          Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA) is a C-language code developed
     to statistically find the best global fit of a  nonlinear  constrained
     non-convex  cost-function  over  a D-dimensional space. This algorithm
     permits  an  annealing  schedule  for   "temperature"   T   decreasing
     exponentially  in  annealing-time  k,  T  =  T_0  exp(-c  k^1/D).  The
     introduction of  re-annealing  also  permits  adaptation  to  changing
     sensitivities   in   the   multi-dimensional   parameter-space.   This
     annealing schedule is faster than fast Cauchy  annealing,  where  T  =
     T_0/k,  and  much faster than Boltzmann annealing, where T = T_0/ln k.
     ASA has over 100 OPTIONS to provide robust tuning over many classes of
     nonlinear stochastic systems.

     3.  Documentation


     3.1.  Table of Contents/Index

          A  compilation  of  the  three  levels of headers with their page
     numbers may be used as a Table of  Contents  placed  after  the  first
     title   page   (as  is  done  for  ASA-README.ps,  ASA-README.pdf  and
     ASA-README.html below), or left at the end for quick reference (as  is
     done for ASA-README.txt below).

     3.2.  ASA-README.ms and ASA-README

          The  ASA-README.ms  file  is  used to prepare other documentation
     files using UNIX(R) MS macros.

     3.2.1.  ASA-README.txt and ASA-README+.txt

          ASA-README.txt is an ASCII file that can  be  previewed  on  your
     screen or sent to an ASCII lineprinter.

          ASA-README+.txt  is  ASA-README.txt  without any filters to strip
     off underlining and bold enhancements.

     3.2.2.  asa.[13nl] Manpage

          The ASA-README.txt or ASA-README+.txt file can  be  copied  to  a
     file    named   asa.[l3],   and   asa.[13]   can   be   installed   as
     MANPATH/cat1/asa.1 or MANPATH/cat3/asa.3, where MANPATH is  the  place
     your  man  directory  is  located.   If  you  do  not have any cat[13]
     directories on your system, then installing a copy  of  ASA-README.txt
     or  ASA-README+.txt  as  MANPATH/man[13nl]/asa.[13nl], choosing one of
     the suffixes in [13nl] for your choice of directory and asa file name,
     should  work  fine on most machines.  However, passing this asa.[13nl]
     through man may strip out additional "back-slash" characters,  leading
     to  missing  words  or  unintended  formatting.   If such a file looks
     strange, compare it to the raw ASA-README.ms  file  to  determine  the
     true  intended content.  You likely can avoid some further undesirable
     formatting by man by placing '.nf' on the first line of this file.

     3.2.3.  ASA-README.ps and ASA-README.pdf

          ASA-README.ps is a PostScript(R)  formatted  file  which  may  be
     previewed on your screen if you have the proper software, or it may be
     sent to a PostScript(R) printer to produce hardcopy.

          A PDF version ASA-README.pdf is prepared from ASA-README.ps.

     3.2.4.  ASA-README.html

          ASA-README.html is an HTML version which enables easier access to
     subsections  of  this  file.  Cross-references have been kept local to
     this file, so you may view it under a local browser  if  you  download
     the HTML source file.

          The    background   image   file   asa_back.jpg   referenced   in
     ASA-README.html         can         be          downloaded          as
     http://www.ingber.com/asa_back.jpg from the ASA archive.

     3.3.  Additional Documentation

          ASA-CHANGES  is  a  terse record of major changes made in the ASA
     code.  It has  three  sections,  CHANGES,  CONTRIBUTORS,  and  VERSION
     DATES.

          ASA-NOTES   is   a   collection   of   recommended  enhancements,
     modifications, comments, caveats, etc., that  might  be  of  interest.
     There  is a CONTENTS of sections headers that can be used to search on
     topics in your browser or editor.

          There  are  three  files  in  the  ASA  archive  that  should  be
     considered     as     appendices     to     the     ASA-NOTES    file:
     http://www.ingber.com/asa_contrib.txt,
     http://www.ingber.com/asa_examples.txt,                            and
     http://www.ingber.com/asa_papers.html under WWW.

          The file http://www.ingber.com/asa_contrib.txt in the ASA archive
     contains  some code contributed by users.  For example, references are

     giving to MATLAB and RLaB gateway routines to ASA (which include  many
     important  parts  of the ASA user module), and to function support for
     ASA_PARALLEL.  There is a CONTENTS of sections  headers  that  can  be
     used  to  search  on topics in your browser or editor.  In this file I
     have included the first 1987 VFSR code, the precursor to the ASA code,
     as  used  on  a  specific  project,  including  the  RATFOR vfsr.r and
     vfsr_com.r code, subsequently  compiled  into  FORTRAN  to  run  on  a
     Lawrence  Livermore  supercomputer.   I do not support this old RATFOR
     code.

          The  file  http://www.ingber.com/asa_examples.txt  in   the   ASA
     archive  contains some example problems using ASA and some code to use
     in ASA.  There is a CONTENTS of sections headers that can be  used  to
     search  on  topics in your browser or editor.  This file contains some
     problems optimized using ASA, which can provide immediate examples  on
     how you can optimize your own problem.

          The  file http://www.ingber.com/asa_papers.html is an addendum to
     the ASA-NOTES file in the ASA  code,  containing  references  to  some
     patents and papers using ASA or its precursor VFSR.

          The  file  asa_new.txt  in  the  ASA  archive  is a list of major
     changes  in  ASA.   The  files   ASA-README.txt,   ASA-README.ps   and
     ASA-README.pdf included with the code also are available independently
     as               http://www.ingber.com/ASA-README.txt                ,
     http://www.ingber.com/ASA-README.ps.gz                               ,
     http://www.ingber.com/ASA-README.html                                ,
     http://www.ingber.com/ASA-README.pdf .

          There  is  a  set of ASA_TEMPLATE's available in the ASA-Makefile
     and in the user module (some also in the asa module) to illustrate use
     of  particular  OPTIONS,  as listed under ASA_TEMPLATE below.  You can
     search on these ASA_TEMPLATE's in your browser or editor  to  see  how
     these  are implemented.  Note that some OPTIONS require your input, as
     described below, and code may fail until you add your own code.   Once
     you  have  determined  the  most  common set of DEFINE_OPTIONS you are
     likely to use, you might place these in your own TEMPLATE at  the  top
     of asa_usr_asa.h at the location specified, e.g.,
        #if MY_TEMPLATE                 /* MY_TEMPLATE_asa_user */
          /* you can add your own set of #define here */
        #define ... TRUE
        #define ... 100
        #endif

          See  http://www.ingber.com/utils_file_formats.txt  for some links
     to information on gzip, PostScript, PDF, tar, and shar utilities.  The
     file   utils_code.txt   in   that  directory  gives  short  statements
     describing    these    files,    which    may    be    accessed     as

     3.4.  Use of Documentation for Tuning

          I  am  often  asked how I can help someone tune their system, and
     they send me their cost function or a list of the ASA OPTIONS they are

     Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)                       Lester Ingber


     using.   Most  often,  the  best help I can provide is based on my own
     experience that  nonlinear  systems  typically  are  non-typical.   In
     practice,  that means that trying to figure out the nature of the cost
     function under sampling in order to tune ASA (or likely  to  similarly
     tune  a  hard problem under any sampling algorithm), by examining just
     the cost function, likely will not be as productive as generating more
     intermediate  printout,  e.g.,  setting  ASA_PRINT_MORE  to  TRUE, and
     looking  at  this  output  as  a  "grey  box"  of  insight  into  your
     optimization  problem.  Larger files with more information is provided
     by setting ASA_PIPE_FILE to TRUE.   Treat  the  output  of  ASA  as  a
     simulation  in  the  ASA  parameter  space,  which  usually is quite a
     different space than the variable space of your system.

          For example, you should  be  able  to  see  where  and  how  your
     solution  might  be  getting  stuck  in a local minima for a very long
     time, or where the last saved state is still fluctuating across a wide
     portion  of  your  state space.  These observations should suggest how
     you might try speeding up or  slowing  down  annealing/quenching  (see
     more  below  on  modifying  ASA  with QUENCH OPTIONS) of the parameter
     space and/or  tightening  or  loosening  the  acceptance  criteria  at
     different  stages  by  modifying  the OPTIONS, e.g., starting with the
     OPTIONS that can be easily adjusted using the asa_opt file.

          The ASA-NOTES file that comes with the  ASA  code  provides  some
     guidelines  for  tuning that may provide some insights, especially the
     section Some Tuning Guidelines.  An especially important guide  is  to
     examine  the  output  of  ASA at several stages of sampling, to see if
     changes in parameter and temperatures  are  reasonably  correlated  to
     changes  in  the  cost  function.  Examples of useful OPTIONS and code
     that often give quick changes in tuning in some problems  are  in  the
     file  http://www.ingber.com/asa_examples.txt  under  WWW.  Some of the
     reprint files of published papers  in  the  ingber.com  provide  other
     examples  in  harder systems, and perhaps you might find some examples
     of   harder   systems   using   ASA   similar   to   your    own    in
     http://www.ingber.com/asa_papers.html under WWW.  This is the best way
     to add some Art to the Science of annealing.

          While the upside of  using  ASA  is  that  it  has  many  OPTIONS
     available  for  tuning,  derived in large part from feedback from many
     users over many years, making it extremely robust across many systems,
     the downside is that the learning curve can be steep especially if the
     default settings or simple tweaking in asa_opt do not work  very  well
     for  your  particular system, and you then must turn to using more ASA
     OPTIONS.   Most  of  these  OPTIONS  have   useful   guides   in   the
     ASA_TEMPLATEs  in asa_usr.c, as well as being documented here.  If you
     really get stuck, you may  consider  working  with  someone  else  who
     already  has  climbed  this  learning curve and whose experience might
     offer quick help.

          Tuning is an essential aspect of any sampling algorithm if it  is
     to  be applied to many classes of systems.  It just doesn't make sense
     to compare sampling algorithms unless you  are  prepared  to  properly
     tune each algorithm to each system being optimized or sampled.

     5.  Background


     5.1.  Context

          Too often the management of complex systems is ill-served by  not
     utilizing  the best tools available.  For example, requirements set by
     decision-makers often are not  formulated  in  the  same  language  as
     constructs  formulated by powerful mathematical formalisms, and so the
     products of analyses are not properly or maximally utilized,  even  if
     and  when  they  come  close  to  faithfully representing the powerful
     intuitions they  are  supposed  to  model.   In  turn,  even  powerful
     mathematical  constructs  are ill-served, especially when dealing with
     multivariate nonlinear complex  systems,  when  these  formalisms  are
     butchered  into  quasi-linear approximations to satisfy constraints of
     numerical algorithms familiar to particular analysts, but  which  tend
     to  destroy  the  power  of  the  intuitive  constructs  developed  by
     decision-makers.

     Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)                       Lester Ingber


          In  order  to  deal  with   fitting   parameters   or   exploring
     sensitivities  of  variables,  as  models  of systems have become more
     sophisticated  in  describing  complex   behavior,   it   has   become
     increasingly  important  to  retain  and  respect  the  nonlinearities
     inherent in these models, as they are indeed present  in  the  complex
     systems  they  model.   ASA can help to handle these fits of nonlinear
     models of real-world data.

          It helps to visualize the  problems  presented  by  such  complex
     systems  as  a geographical terrain.  For example, consider a mountain
     range,  with  two  "parameters,"  e.g.,  along  the  North-South   and
     East-West  directions.   We  wish  to  find  the lowest valley in this
     terrain.  ASA approaches this problem similar to using a bouncing ball
     that  can  bounce over mountains from valley to valley.  We start at a
     high "temperature," where the temperature is  an  ASA  parameter  that
     mimics the effect of a fast moving particle in a hot object like a hot
     molten metal, thereby permitting the ball to make  very  high  bounces
     and being able to bounce over any mountain to access any valley, given
     enough bounces.  As the temperature is  made  relatively  colder,  the
     ball  cannot  bounce so high, and it also can settle to become trapped
     in relatively smaller ranges of valleys.

          We imagine that our mountain range is aptly described by a  "cost
     function."  We define probability distributions of the two directional
     parameters,  called  generating  distributions  since  they   generate
     possible  valleys  or  states  we  are  to explore.  We define another
     distribution, called the acceptance distribution, which depends on the
     difference of cost functions of the present generated valley we are to
     explore and the last saved lowest valley.  The acceptance distribution
     is  used  to decide whether to stay in a new lower valley or to bounce
     out of it.  All the generating and acceptance distributions depend  on
     temperatures.

          The  ASA  code was first developed in 1987 as Very Fast Simulated
     Reannealing (VFSR) to deal with the necessity of  performing  adaptive
     global  optimization  on multivariate nonlinear stochastic systems[2].
     The first published use of VFSR for a complex systems  was  in  combat
     analysis,  using  a  model of combat first developed in 1986, and then
     applied to exercise and simulation data in a  series  of  papers  that
     spanned  1988-1993[3].  The first applications to combat analysis used
     code written in RATFOR and converted into FORTRAN.  Other applications
     since  then  have  used  new  code  written in C.  (The ASA-NOTES file
     contains some comments on interfacing ASA with FORTRAN codes.)

          In November 1992, the VFSR C-code was rewritten,  e.g.,  changing
     to  the  use of long descriptive names, and made publicly available as
     version 6.35 under a "copyleft" GNU General Public  License  (GPL)[4],
     and copies were placed in NETLIB and STATLIB.

          Beginning  in  January 93, many adaptive features were developed,
     largely in response to users' requests,  leading  to  this  ASA  code.
     Until 1996, ASA was located at http://www.alumni.caltech.edu/~ingber/.
     Pointers were placed in NETLIB and  STATLIB  to  this  location.   ASA
     versions  1.1  through  5.13 retained the GPL, but subsequent versions

     through this one have incorporated a  simpler  ASA-LICENSE,  based  in
     part  on  a  University  of  California  license,  that  protects  the
     integrity of the algorithm, promotes widespread  usage,  and  requires
     reference  to  current  source  code.  Beginning with version 29.1 the
     ASA-LICENSE was replaced with The Open Source Initiative BSD  3-Clause

          ASA  has  been  examined in the context of a review of methods of
     simulated  annealing  using   annealing   versus   quenching   (faster
     temperature  schedules  than  permitted  by  basic  heuristic proof of
     ergodicity -- see more below on modifying ASA with QUENCH OPTIONS)[5].
     A  paper has indicated how this technique can be enhanced by combining
     it with some other powerful algorithms, e.g., to produce an  algorithm
     for  parallel  computation[6].  ASA is now used world-wide across many
     disciplines[7,8,9,10],  including   specific   disciplines   such   as
     finance[11,12,13,14,15,16,17],  neuroscience[18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25],
     and combat analyses[26,27,28,29,30,31,32].  Some papers illustrate the
     combined  use of ASA for optimization and sampling[33,34,35,36,37,38].
     The http://www.ingber.com/asa_papers.html  file  in  the  ASA  archive
     contains references to some patents and papers using ASA and VFSR.

     5.2.  Outline of ASA Algorithm

          Details of the ASA algorithm are best obtained from the published
     papers.  There are three parts  to  its  basic  structure:  Generating
     Probability   Density   Functions,   Acceptance   Probability  Density
     Functions, and Temperature Schedules.

     5.2.1.  Simulated Annealing is NOT Simulated Quenching

          As  an  aside,  it is very important to understand that Simulated
     Annealing (SA) is NOT Simulated Quenching (SQ).  The issue is that  SA
     is not just one algorithm -- it is a class of approaches to importance
     sampling.

          Different  SA   algorithms   may   have   different   probability
     distributions they use to generate new states for consideration by the
     acceptance criteria.  The often-cited SA proof of convergence  depends



                                      - 7 -





     Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)                       Lester Ingber


     on  this generating probability distribution, which leads to different
     temperature schedules for different  distributions.

          If a schedule-1 derived for one SA-1 is faster than a  schedule-2
     derived  for  a  different SA-2, but one uses schedule-1 with the SA-2
     algorithm, then SQ-2 is being used and not SA-2.  The proof  for  SA-2
     will  fail  using  schedule-1 (although the mixed algorithm might work
     just fine).

          SQ is not a "bad" thing.  It's just that one cannot cite  the  SA
     proof of convergence, although the SQ being used might be really among
     the best algorithms being used for a given system.  For example, there
     is  no  doubt  that  Newton's  method  is superior to SA for parabolic
     objective functions.  The point is  that  there  are  proofs  that  SA
     likely can do more for more complex problems, although it might not be
     the most efficient algorithm for a specific system.

          See more below on how to modify ASA with QUENCH  OPTIONS,  easily
     permitting various degrees of quenching.  This is especially useful if
     you determine that your optimal state(s) can be reached using SQ.

     5.2.2.  Generating Probability Density Function

          In a D-dimensional parameter space  with  parameters  p^i  having
     ranges  [A_i,  B_i],  about  the  k'th last saved point (e.g., a local
     optima), p_k^i, a new point is generated using a distribution  defined
     by  the product of distributions for each parameter, g^i(y^i; T_i), in
     terms of random variables y^i in [-1, 1],  where  p_k+1^i  =  p_k^i  +
     y^i(B_i - A_i), and "temperatures" T_i,
             g^i(y^i; T_i) = 1/[2(|y^i| + T_i)(1 + 1/T_i)].
     The   DEFINE_OPTIONS   USER_GENERATING_FUNCTION   permits   using   an
     alternative to this ASA distribution function.

     5.2.3.  Acceptance Probability Density Function

          The cost functions, C(p_k+1)  -  C(p_k),  are  compared  using  a
     uniform random generator, U in [0, 1), in a "Boltzmann" test: If
             exp[-(C(p_k+1) - C(p_k))/T_cost] > U,
     where  T_cost  is  the  "temperature" used for this test, then the new
     point is accepted as the new  saved  point  for  the  next  iteration.
     Otherwise,  the  last  saved  point  is  retained.  The DEFINE_OPTIONS
     USER_ACCEPT_ASYMP_EXP   or    USER_ACCEPT_THRESHOLD    permit    using
     alternatives to this Boltzmann distribution function.

     5.2.4.  Reannealing Temperature Schedule

          The  annealing schedule for each parameter temperature, T_i, from
     a starting temperature T_i0, is
             T_i(k_i) = T_0i exp(-c_i k_i^(1/D)).
     This is discussed further below.

          The annealing schedule for  the  cost  temperature  is  developed
     similarly  to  the  parameter  temperatures.   However,  the index for
     reannealing the cost function, k_cost, is determined by the number  of



                                      - 8 -





     Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)                       Lester Ingber


     accepted points, instead of the number of generated points as used for
     the parameters.  This choice was made because the Boltzmann acceptance
     criteria  uses  an exponential distribution which is not as fat-tailed
     as the ASA distribution used for the parameters.  This schedule can be
     modified  using  several  OPTIONS.   In  particular,  the  Pre-Compile
     DEFINE_OPTIONS USER_COST_SCHEDULE permits quite  arbitrary  functional
     modifications   for  this  annealing  schedule,  and  the  Pre-Compile
     DEFINE_OPTIONS

          As determined by the  Program  Options  selected,  the  parameter
     "temperatures" may be periodically adaptively reannealed, or increased
     relative  to  their  previous  values,  using  their  relative   first
     derivatives  with  respect  to  the cost function, to guide the search
     "fairly" among the parameters.

          As determined by the Program Options selected, the reannealing of
     the  cost  temperature  resets  the scale of the annealing of the cost
     acceptance criteria as
             T_cost(k_cost) = T_0cost exp(-c_cost k_cost^(1/D)).
     The new T_0cost is taken to be the minimum of the current initial cost
     temperature  and  the  maximum  of the absolute values of the best and
     last  cost  functions  and  their  difference.   The  new  k_cost   is
     calculated  taking  T_cost as the maximum of the current value and the
     absolute value of the difference  between  the  last  and  best  saved
     minima  of  the  cost  function, constrained not to exceed the current
     initial cost temperature.  This procedure essentially resets the scale
     of  the  annealing  of  the  cost  temperature within the scale of the
     current best or last saved minimum.

          This default algorithm  for  reannealing  the  cost  temperature,
     taking  advantage  of  the  ASA  importance sampling that relates most
     specifically to the  parameter  temperatures,  while  often  is  quite
     efficient  for some systems, may lead to problems in dwelling too long
     in local minima for other systems.  In such case, the  user  may  also
     experiment    with   alternative   algorithms   effected   using   the
     Reanneal_Cost OPTIONS, discussed below.  For example, ASA provides  an
     alternative calculation for the cost temperature, when Reanneal_Cost <
     -1 or > 1, that periodically calculates the initial and  current  cost
     temperatures  or  just  the  initial  cost  temperature,  resp.,  as a
     deviation over a sample of cost functions.

          These reannealing algorithms can be  changed  adaptively  by  the
     user  as  described  below  in  the  sections  USER_REANNEAL_COST  and
     USER_REANNEAL_PARAMETERS.

     5.3.  Efficiency Versus Necessity

          ASA is not necessarily an "efficient" code.  For example, if  you
     know  that  your cost function to be optimized is something close to a
     parabola, then a simple gradient  Newton  search  method  most  likely
     would  be  faster  than  ASA.   ASA  is believed to be faster and more
     robust than other simulated  annealing  techniques  for  most  complex
     problems  with  multiple  local optima; again, be careful to note that
     some problems are best treated by other algorithms.   If  you  do  not



                                      - 9 -





     Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)                       Lester Ingber


     know much about the structure of your system, and especially if it has
     complex constraints, and you need to search for a global optimum, then
     this ASA code is heartily recommended to you.

          In  the  context  of efficiency and necessity, the user should be
     alert to recognize that any sampling or optimization program generally
     should be considered as complementary, not as a substitute, to gaining
     knowledge of a particular system.  Unlike  relatively  "canned"  codes
     that exist for (quasi-)linear systems, nonlinear systems typically are
     non-typical.  Often some homework  must  be  done  to  understand  the
     system,  and  tuning often is required of numerical algorithms such as
     ASA.  For example, while  principal  component  analyses  (PCA)  often
     suffices  to  generate  good (quasi-)orthogonal or (quasi-)independent
     sets of parameters, this is not true for  general  nonlinear  systems.
     While such innovations as reannealing take good advantage of ASA which
     offers independent distributions for each  parameter,  this  generally
     may  not  be  a  good  substitute  for a user-defined front-end, e.g.,
     before the call to asa () or even embedded  within  the  cost_function
     (), to interpret and define relevant parameters.

          The  ASA-NOTES  file  contains the sections @@Number of Generated
     States Required and @@Judging Importance-Sampling, recommending use of
     log-log  plots  to extrapolate the number of generated states required
     to attain a  global  minimum,  possibly  as  a  function  of  selected
     OPTIONS.

     6.  Outline of Use

     Set  up  the  ASA  interface:  Your program should be divided into two
     basic modules.  (1) The user calling procedure,  containing  the  cost
     function  to  be  minimized  (or  its negative if you require a global
     maximum), is contained in asa_usr.c, asa_usr.h and asa_usr_cst.c.  (2)
     The  ASA optimization procedure, is contained in asa.c and asa.h.  The
     file asa_usr_asa.h contains definitions  and  macros  common  to  both
     asa.h   and   asa_usr.h.   Furthermore,  there  are  some  options  to
     explore/read below.  It is assumed there will be no confusion over the
     standard  uses of the term "parameter" in different contexts, e.g., as
     an element passed by a subroutine or as a physical  coefficient  in  a
     cost function.

          ASA  has  been  run  successfully  on  many  machines  under many
     compilers.  To check out your own system, you can run `make`  (or  the
     equivalent  set  of  commands  in  the ASA-Makefile), and compare your
     asa_out and asa_usr_out files to  the  asa_test_asa  and  asa_test_usr
     files,  respectively, provided with this code.  No attempt was made to
     optimize any compiler, so that the test runs do not really signify any
     testing  of  compilers  or  architectures; rather they are meant to be
     used as a guide to  determine  what  you  might  expect  on  your  own
     machine.

          The major sections below describe the compilation procedures, the
     Program Options available to you to  control  the  code,  the  use  of
     templates  to set up your user module and interface to the asa module,
     and how to submit bug reports.

     Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)                       Lester Ingber


          If you already have your  own  cost  function  defined,  you  can
     insert  it into asa_usr_cst.c.  If you wish to insert more OPTIONS, as
     a quick guide to get started, you can search through asa_usr.c and the
     ASA-Makefile  for  all  occurrences  of  "MY_TEMPLATE_"  to insert the
     necessary  definitions  required  to  run  ASA.   If  you   use   both
     OPTIONS_FILE and OPTIONS_FILE_DATA set to TRUE, then usually most such
     information can be placed in the  asa_opt  file,  and  then  only  the
     cost_function   ()   must  be  inserted.   The  place  to  insert  the
     cost_function () is marked by "MY_TEMPLATE_cost."

     7.  ASA-Makefile/Compilation Procedures

     The ASA-Makefile is intended to be a template for your  own  Makefile.
     For  quick  use,  just  copy  this  file  to  Makefile,  which will be
     recognized by any standard make tool.

          The PostScript(R)  ASA-README.ps  and  ASCII  ASA-README.txt  and
     ASA-README+.txt   files   were   generated   using  `make  doc`.   The
     ASA-Makefile  describes  some  options  for  formatting  these   files
     differently.  Use `make` or `make all` to compile and run asa_run, the
     executable prepared for the test function.  Examine  the  ASA-Makefile
     to determine the "clean" options available.

          Since complex problems by their nature are often quite unique, it
     is unlikely that the  default  parameters  are  just  right  for  your
     problem.   However,  experience  has shown that if you a priori do not
     have any reason to determine your own parameters, then  you  might  do
     just  fine  using  these  defaults,  and  these  are  recommended as a
     first-order guess.  These defaults can be changed simply by adding  to
     the  DEFINE_OPTIONS  line  in  the ASA-Makefile, by passing options on
     your command line, and by changing structure elements in the  user  or
     asa  module  as  described  below.  Depending on how you integrate ASA
     into your own user modules, you may wish to modify  this  ASA-Makefile
     or  at  least  use  some  of  these  options  in  your own compilation
     procedures.

          Note  that  the  ASA-Makefile  is  just  a  convenience,  not   a
     necessity,  to  use  ASA.   E.g., on systems which do not support this
     utility, you may simply compile the files following the guidelines  in
     the  ASA-Makefile,  taking  care to pass the correct DEFINE_OPTIONS to
     your compilation commands at your shell prompt.   Still  another  way,
     albeit  not  as  convenient,  is  to  make  the desired changes in the
     asa_usr_asa.h, and asa.h or asa_usr.h files as required.

          Since   the   ASA-Makefile   contains   comments   giving   short
     descriptions  of some options, it should be considered as an extension
     of this documentation file.  For convenience, most of this information
     is  repeated  below.   However,  to  see  how  they  can  be  used  in
     compilations, please read through the ASA-Makefile.

          For example, to run the ASA test problem using the gcc  compiler,
     you could just type at your "%" prompt:
             % cp ASA-Makefile Makefile
             % gcc -g -DASA_TEST=TRUE -o asa_run asa_usr.c asa_usr_cst.c asa.c -lm

     Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)                       Lester Ingber


             % asa_run
     Note  that  if  you  use  gcc  across  different  levels  of  compiler
     optimization on different platforms, you may wish to  invoke  -ffloat-
     store to be sure to get the same precision in your results.

          If  you  have  defined your own cost function in asa_usr_cst.c or
     within the "MY_TEMPLATE_" guides in asa_usr.c, then ASA_TEST should be
     set  to  FALSE  (the  default  if  ASA_TEST  is  not  defined  in your
     compilation lines or in the ASA-Makefile).  The code for ASA_TEST=TRUE
     is  given  just  above  these guides as a template to use for your own
     cost function.

          The easiest way for many users to quickly use ASA  likely  is  to
     invoke the COST_FILE, OPTIONS_FILE, and OPTIONS_FILE_DATA OPTIONS (the
     default), using the files  asa_usr_cst.c  and  asa_opt  as  templates.
     This   is   further   described   below   and   illustrated   in   the
     http://www.ingber.com/asa_examples.txt file  in  the  section  Use  of
     COST_FILE on Shubert Problem.

     7.1.  DLL ASA-Makefile

          Under Cygwin (cygwin.com), set ASA_LIB to TRUE and INCL_STDOUT to
     FALSE (OPTIONS described below), with the command
             % make asadll
     to produce a DLL to call asa_main() as a DLL function  under  windows.
     (Ignore   any  undefined  references  to  _WinMain.)   Note  that  per
     instructions given in the ASA-Makefile, i686-pc-mingw32-gcc.exe should
     be used.

          If  paths  are  used  to  access files in code, under Windows use
     absolute  paths  with   "\\"   (double   back   slash)   to   separate
     folders/directories,  instead  of  relative  paths  with  "/"  (single
     forward slash) separators as on other Unix platforms.

     8.  Generic ASA Interfaces

     The sections above describe how to quickly adapt ASA for use  in  many
     problems.   However,  complex projects often require sophisticated use
     of multiple languages to handle data and multiple algorithms.  ASA has
     many  OPTIONS  that  enable  users  to interface ASA with such complex
     projects.

          ASA should compile under C++ as well as under C  compilers.   For
     example,  I regularly test this by running projects under both gcc and
     g++.  This can be very useful  when  ASA  is  called  from  other  C++
     programs,  e.g.,  when  using ASA_LIB set to TRUE.  The ASA-NOTES file
     has additional information, e.g., when using SUNPRO CC, etc.

          I have led many projects that  required  ASA  to  interface  with
     Java, Maple, Matlab, MySQL, etc.  The approach briefly described below
     can be applied to any language that permits a simple  interface  to  C
     code.   This  definitely  requires some expert experience in C, so you
     may have to find a local C guru, since I cannot  help  you  with  your
     specific project.

     Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)                       Lester Ingber


          Some  specific interfaces have been prepared by other people, and
     I have included  some  of  them  in  the  asa_contrib.txt  file.   The
     tradeoff  for their simple use is that these approaches are limited to
     using just a few ASA OPTIONS as they typically have trimmed  down  the
     ASA code.

          The  generic  approach is to utilize at least the OPTIONS ASA_LIB
     and OPTIONAL_DATA_PTR, setting them  to  TRUE.   ASA_LIB  permits  the
     entire ASA code to be called as a simple function.  Its sole parameter
     can be a struct defined by OPTIONAL_PTR_TYPE, e.g.,  OPTIONAL_PTR_TYPE
     PROJECT,  defined  in  asa_usr_asa.h.   A small include file common to
     asa_usr_asa.h and to the larger complex project, e.g.,  project.h,  is
     used  to  define  the  constituents  of  the  the  PROJECT struct.  As
     described above in the DLL  ASA-Makefile  sub-Section  of  Section  7,
     ASA_LIB can be used to create a DLL to be called by Windows programs.

          A  small  C  function,  e.g.,  project.c,  is  to be used for the
     interface between ASA and  the  other  language.   Similarly,  another
     small function also may be used to interface the project to handle the
     interface,   e.g.,   project.m,   project.java,   project.mpl,    etc.
     Inversely,  the  interface  may  (also)  be between the cost function,
     e.g., in asa_usr_cst.c  or  asa_usr.c,  and  the  project.   Then  the
     application  below  is  used  to  pass  information  between  the cost
     function and the other language.

          The other language  passes  information  and  data  to  project.c
     required  by  ASA,  where  it  is  packed  into  the struct defined by
     OPTIONAL_PTR_TYPE.  Multiple or recursive calls to ASA can be  handled
     by  including  a  flag in this struct, e.g., to turn on different cost
     functions.  Also added to this struct are placeholders for the  output
     of ASA required by the project.  This struct is passed to the ASA code
     by calling asa_main () defined in asa_usr.c with a  parameter  PROJECT
     *Project.   In  asa_main  (),  in  the  section defining properties of
     OPTIONAL_DATA_PTR, the pointer to Project struct is set to the pointer
     path  to  Asa_Data_Ptr.   Asa_Data_Ptr  is  now  passed throughout the
     entire ASA code via the OPTIONS pointer,  project  parameters  can  be
     adaptively changed, etc.  See the discussion under Asa_Data_Ptr.

          After  the  call to asa () in asa_usr.c, its output can be packed
     into  the  project  struct,  before  memory  is  freed.   The  pointer
     Asa_Data_Ptr  should  be set to NULL instead of freed; see the comment
     in asa_usr.c at the place Asa_Data_Ptr is freed in the default code.

          It is wise to create #define PROJECT and  #endif  pairs  wherever
     changes  to  any  ASA  code  are  made,  define  PROJECT  to  TRUE  in
     asa_usr_asa.h, so that it will be easy to  modify  updated  ASA  code,
     etc.  Probably several such changes will have to be made in asa_usr.c.
     Control of OPTIONS likely will best be handled in  asa_usr_asa.h  than
     in the ASA-Makefile.

     9.  User Options

     Program  Options,  i.e.,  the  USER_DEFINES  typedef  on  the OPTIONS,
     USER_OPTIONS, RECUR_USER_OPTIONS,  etc.,  are  turned  on  during  the

     running  of  asa ().  The DEFINE_OPTIONS are compiled in by the use of
     arguments to the compilation or by setting them in  the  asa_usr_asa.h
     file.  An example of the former is Reanneal_Parameters, and an example
     of the latter is ASA_SAMPLE.  The basic code is kept  small  for  most
     users  by  using  the Pre-Compile DEFINE_OPTIONS to pull in additional
     DEFINE_OPTIONS only if required.  The Program Options are intended  to
     be  used  adaptively and/or to pull in additional code for cases where
     repeated or recursive use, e.g., when using  SELF_OPTIMIZE,  might  be
     facilitated  by  having  control  of  some Program Options at separate
     levels.

          Note that even when the DEFINE_OPTIONS  or  Program  Options  are
     used  to  pull  in  new  code,  separate levels of control also can be
     achieved, albeit usually at the price of incurring  some  overhead  in
     setting  values  at  some  levels of recursion or repeated calls.  For
     example, in cases where new arrays or functions come into play, enough
     parameters  are  passed  between the asa and user modules to calculate
     the defaults as well as different values adaptively.   In  some  often
     used cases, separate DEFINE_OPTIONS are given, e.g., both OPTIONS_FILE
     and RECUR_OPTIONS_FILE exist.  I have tried to strike some  reasonable
     balance between these goals and constraints.

          The  DEFINE_OPTIONS  are  organized  into two groups: Pre-Compile
     Options and (Pre-Compile) Printing Options.  In  addition,  there  are
     some  alternatives  to  explore  under  Compiler  Choices and Document
     Formatting.  Below are the DEFINE_OPTIONS with  their  defaults.   The
     Program  Options  are  further  discussed  in  other  sections in this
     document.

          Note that the  Pre-Compile  DEFINE_OPTIONS  are  all  in  capital
     letters,   and   the   adaptive   Program   Options  (under  structure
     USER_OPTIONS in the user module and under structure OPTIONS in the asa
     module)  are  in  capital and lower-case letters.  In this file, often
     just the term OPTIONS may refer to the set of  all  options  when  the
     context is clear.

     9.1.  Pre-Compile DEFINE_OPTIONS


     9.1.1.  USER_COST_FUNCTION=cost_function

          The default name of the cost function is cost_function.  This can
     be  changed  in  asa_usr_asa.h  (or  the  ASA-Makefile)  by   defining
     USER_COST_FUNCTION.  This of course requires compiling in the new cost
     function and its prototype.

     9.1.2.  RECUR_USER_COST_FUNCTION=recur_cost_function

          When  SELF_OPTIMIZE  is  TRUE, the default name of the recur cost
     function is recur_cost_function.  This can be changed in asa_usr_asa.h
     (or  the  ASA-Makefile) by defining RECUR_USER_COST_FUNCTION.  This of
     course requires compiling in the new cost function and its prototype.

     Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)                       Lester Ingber


     9.1.3.  OPTIONS_FILE=TRUE

          You can elect to read in many of the Program Options from asa_opt
     by  setting  OPTIONS_FILE=TRUE.   OPTIONS_FILE=TRUE  can be set in the
     ASA-Makefile in compilation commands or in asa_usr_asa.h.

     9.1.4.  OPTIONS_FILE_DATA=TRUE

          If OPTIONS_FILE is set to TRUE, then setting OPTIONS_FILE_DATA to
     TRUE  permits  reading  most  initialization  data from asa_opt, i.e.,
     number of parameters, minimum and maximum ranges, initial values,  and
     integer  or  real  types.   This should suffice for most applications,
     just  requiring   insertion   of   the   user's   cost_function   into
     asa_usr_cst.c or asa_usr.c.

          If OPTIONS_FILE, OPTIONS_FILE_DATA and QUENCH_COST are TRUE, then
     *User_Quench_Cost_Scale is read in  from  asa_opt.   If  OPTIONS_FILE,
     OPTIONS_FILE_DATA,  QUENCH_COST,  and QUENCH_PARAMETERS are TRUE, then
     *User_Quench_Cost_Scale and User_Quench_Param_Scale [] all are read in
     from asa_opt.

     9.1.5.  RECUR_OPTIONS_FILE=FALSE

          When  SELF_OPTIMIZE is TRUE, you can elect to read in many of the
     Program Options for the top-level program  from  asa_opt_recur  (which
     you  will  have  to  create  in  the  style  of  asa_opt),  by setting
     RECUR_OPTIONS_FILE=TRUE.

     9.1.6.  RECUR_OPTIONS_FILE_DATA=FALSE

          When SELF_OPTIMIZE is TRUE, if RECUR_OPTIONS_FILE is set to TRUE,
     then  setting  RECUR_OPTIONS_FILE_DATA  to  TRUE  permits reading most
     initialization data from asa_opt_recur (which you will have to  create
     in  the  style  of  asa_opt),  i.e., number of parameters, minimum and
     maximum ranges, initial values, and integer or real types.

          If RECUR_OPTIONS_FILE,  RECUR_OPTIONS_FILE_DATA  and  QUENCH_COST
     are  TRUE, then *User_Quench_Cost_Scale is read in from asa_opt_recur.
     If  RECUR_OPTIONS_FILE,  RECUR_OPTIONS_FILE_DATA,   QUENCH_COST,   and
     QUENCH_PARAMETERS   are   TRUE,   then   *User_Quench_Cost_Scale   and
     User_Quench_Param_Scale [] all are read in from asa_opt_recur.

     9.1.7.  COST_FILE=TRUE

          If COST_FILE is set to TRUE, then you can use a separate file  to
     define  your  cost function.  When used together with OPTIONS_FILE and
     OPTIONS_FILE_DATA both set to TRUE, most users may be able to just use
     their  own asa_usr_cst.c file for their cost_function () together with
     the asa_opt data file, and not  have  to  work  through  some  of  the
     examples and templates contained in asa_usr.c.

          When  COST_FILE  is  set to TRUE, the file asa_usr_cst.c contains
     cost_function ().  If you wish to change the name of cost_function  ()
     in  asa_usr_cst.c,  then you must also change this name in the call to

     asa () in asa_usr.c (search  under  "asa  (")  and  in  the  prototype
     listing in asa_usr.h (in the HAVE_ANSI set to TRUE or FALSE section as
     appropriate).  You may wish to copy the appropriate parameter list  in
     asa_usr_cst.c just before the ASA_TEST problem to be sure of using the
     proper format expected by asa () in asa.c.

          The  http://www.ingber.com/asa_examples.txt   file   contains   a
     section  Use  of  COST_FILE  on  Shubert Problem which illustrates the
     simple modifications of ASA required to use COST_FILE.

     9.1.8.  ASA_LIB=FALSE

          Setting ASA_LIB=TRUE will facilitate your  running  asa ()  as  a
     library  call  from another program, calling asa_main () in asa_usr.c.
     In the templates  provided,  all  initializations  and  cost  function
     definitions  are set up in the user module.  For example, you may wish
     to have some data read in to a module that  calls  asa_main  (),  then
     parses  out  this  information  to  the  arrays  in  asa_main  ()  and
     initialize_parameters (and possibly recur_initialize_parameters).   In
     conjunction   with   setting  printout  to  stdout  (see  ASA_OUT  and
     USER_ASA_OUT), this can be a convenient way of using the same  asa_run
     executable for many runs.

          When  ASA_LIB  is  TRUE,  another  function  becomes available in
     asa_usr.c, asa_seed (), which can be used to change the  initial  seed
     used in runs made by asa_main ().  If this routine is not called, then
     the default initial seed is used.  An example of  using  this  routine
     when  calling asa_main () is given with ASA_TEMPLATE_LIB, using a main
     () at the end of the asa_usr.c file.

          As described in the DLL ASA-Makefile sub-Section  of  Section  7,
     the  ASA-Makefile  and ASA_LIB can be used to create a DLL for Windows
     programs.

     9.1.9.  HAVE_ANSI=TRUE

          Setting HAVE_ANSI=FALSE will permit you to use  an  older  K&R  C
     compiler.   This  option  can  be  used  if  you  do  not have an ANSI
     compiler,  overriding  the  default  HAVE_ANSI=TRUE.    If   you   use
     HAVE_ANSI=FALSE,  change  CC  and  CDEBUGFLAGS  as  described  in  the
     ASA-Makefile.

     9.1.10.  IO_PROTOTYPES=FALSE

          Most  newer  operating  systems  do  not  like  any   other   I/O
     prototyping  other  than  those  in  their  own  include files.  Other
     machines, like a Dec-3100 under Ultrix  complain  that  the  ANSI  I/O
     prototypes  were inconsistent.  A Sun under 4.1.x gcc gave warnings if
     no I/O prototypes were present.  The  defaults  in  asa_usr_asa.h  use
     newer   system  prototypes.   IO_PROTOTYPES=TRUE  will  uncomment  out
     declarations for such items as  fprintf,  fflush,  fclose,  exit,  and
     fscanf.

     9.1.11.  TIME_CALC=FALSE

          Some systems do not have the time include files used here; others
     have different scales for time.  Setting  TIME_CALC=TRUE  will  permit
     use of the time routines.

     9.1.12.  TIME_STD=FALSE

          Some    systems,   e.g.,   hpux   and   Cygwin   (with   i686-pc-
     mingw32-gcc.exe), use  other  Unix-standard  macros  to  access  time.
     Setting  TIME_STD=TRUE  when  using TIME_CALC=TRUE will use these time
     routines instead.

     9.1.13.  TIME_GETRUSAGE=TRUE

          An additional module for using TIME_CALC  set  to  TRUE,  setting
     TIME_GETRUSAGE  to  FALSE,  is  more  portable  to compile across some
     platforms, e.g., Cygwin (with  i686-pc-mingw32-gcc.exe),  but  it  can
     require  different  parameters for timing results.  Comments have been
     placed in the code in asa.c.

     9.1.14.  INT_LONG=TRUE

          Some smaller systems choke on 'long int' and this option  can  be
     set  to  INT_LONG=FALSE to turn off warnings and possibly some errors.
     The cast LONG_INT is used to define 'int' or 'long int' appropriately.

     9.1.15.  INT_ALLOC=FALSE

          The cast on *number_parameters is set to ALLOC_INT which defaults
     to  LONG_INT.  On some machines, ALLOC_INT might have to be set to int
     if there is a strict requirement to use an (unsigned) int for  calloc,
     while  'long  int'  still  can  be  used for other aspects of ASA.  If
     ALLOC_INT is to be set to int, set INT_ALLOC to TRUE.

     9.1.16.  SMALL_FLOAT=1.0E-18

          SMALL_FLOAT is a measure of accuracy permitted in log and  divide
     operations  in asa, i.e., which is not precisely equivalent to a given
     machine's precision.  There also  are  Pre-Compile  DEFINE_OPTIONS  to
     separately set constants for minimum and maximum doubles and precision
     permitted  by  your  machine.   Experts  who  require  the  very  best
     precision can fine-tune these parameters in the code.

          Such  issues  arise  because the fat tail of ASA, associated with
     high parameter temperatures,  is  very  important  for  searching  the
     breadth  of  the  ranges  especially  in the initial stages of search.
     However, the parameter temperatures require small values at the  final
     stages  of the search to converge to the best solution, albeit this is
     reached very quickly given the  exponential  schedule  proven  in  the
     referenced  publications  to  be  permissible with ASA.  Note that the
     test problem in asa_usr_cst.c and asa_usr.c is  a  particularly  nasty
     one, with 1E20 local minima and requiring ASA to search over 12 orders
     of magnitude of the cost function before correctly finding the  global

     minimum.     Thus,   intermediate   values   disagree   somewhat   for
     SMALL_FLOAT=1.0E-12 from the settings using  SMALL_FLOAT=1.0E-18  (the
     default);   they  agree  if  SMALL_FLOAT=1.0E-12  while  also  setting
     MIN_DOUBLE=1.0E-18.   The   results   diverge   when   the   parameter
     temperatures  get  down to the range of E-12, limiting the accuracy of
     the SMALL_FLOAT=1.0E-12 run.

          On  some  machines  that   have   register   variables   assigned
     inconsistently  with  other  doubles,  there  can arise some numerical
     differences in some systems.  There has been no such problem found  on
     Sun/Solaris 2.x using gcc, but some problems have been noticed on some
     Intel chips using different gcc optimizations.

          As mentioned above, note  that  the  use  of  -ffloat-store  with
     gcc/g++  is  to  maintain the same level of precision across levels of
     compiler optimization on different platforms.

     9.1.17.  MIN_DOUBLE=SMALL_FLOAT

          You can define your own machine's minimum positive double here if
     you know it.

     9.1.18.  MAX_DOUBLE=1.0/SMALL_FLOAT

          You can define your own machine's maximum double here if you know
     it.

     9.1.19.  EPS_DOUBLE=SMALL_FLOAT

          You can define your own machine's maximum precision here  if  you
     know it.

     9.1.20.  CHECK_EXPONENT=FALSE

          When  CHECK_EXPONENT is set to TRUE, the macro EXPONENT_CHECK(x),
     defined in asa.h in terms of MIN_DOUBLE and MAX_DOUBLE, checks that an
     exponent  x is within a valid range and, if not, adjusts its magnitude
     to fit in the range.

     9.1.21.  NO_PARAM_TEMP_TEST=FALSE

          If  NO_PARAM_TEMP_TEST  is  set  to  TRUE,  then  all   parameter
     temperatures  less  than EPS_DOUBLE are set to EPS_DOUBLE, and no exit
     is called.

     9.1.22.  NO_COST_TEMP_TEST=FALSE

          If NO_COST_TEMP_TEST is set to TRUE, then a cost temperature less
     than EPS_DOUBLE is set to EPS_DOUBLE, and no exit is called.

     9.1.23.  SELF_OPTIMIZE=FALSE

          The  user module contains a template to illustrate how ASA may be
     used  to  self-optimize  its  Program  Options.   This  can  be   very

     Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)                       Lester Ingber


     CPU-expensive  and  is  of  course  dependent  on  how you define your
     recursive cost function (recur_cost_function in the user module).  The
     example  given returns from recur_cost_function the number of function
     evaluations taken to optimization the  test  cost_function,  with  the
     constraint  to only accept optimizations of the cost_function that are
     lower than a specified value.  A few lines of code can be  uncommented
     in asa_usr.c to force a fast exit for this demo; search for FAST EXIT.
     (Note that this also could achieved by  using  OPTIONS->Immediate_Exit
     discussed below.)

          The  ASA_TEMPLATE_SELFOPT  example uses OPTIONS_FILE=FALSE in the
     Pre-Compile Options.  Note that DEFINE_OPTIONS  OPTIONS_FILE=TRUE  and
     OPTIONS_FILE_DATA=TRUE  here  would  take  data  from  asa_opt for the
     lower-level program using the cost_function ().   Both  DEFINE_OPTIONS
     RECUR_OPTIONS_FILE and RECUR_OPTIONS_FILE_DATA would have to be set to
     TRUE to use  asa_opt_recur  to  read  in  both  the  OPTIONS  and  the
     recur_cost_parameters data (which you would have to write in the style
     of asa_opt) for the top-level recur_cost_function ().

          This can be useful when approaching  a  new  system,  and  it  is
     suspected  that  the  default  ASA  Program  Options  are  not  at all
     efficient for this system.   It  is  suggested  that  a  trimmed  cost
     function  or data set be used to get a reasonable guess for a good set
     of Program Options.  ASA has demonstrated that it typically  is  quite
     robust  under a given set of Program Options, so it might not make too
     much sense to spend  lots  of  resources  performing  additional  fine
     tuning of the these options.  Also, it is possible you might crash the
     code  by  permitting  ranges  of  Program  Options  that  cause   your
     particular cost_function to return garbage to asa ().

     9.1.24.  ASA_TEST=FALSE

          Setting  ASA_TEST  to  TRUE  will  permit  running  the  ASA test
     problem.   This  has  been  added  to  the   DEFINE_OPTIONS   in   the
     ASA-Makefile  so  that just running make will run the test problem for
     the new user.  No attempt was made to optimize  any  OPTIONS  for  the
     ASA_TEST problem as it appears in the standard code.

     9.1.25.  ASA_TEST_POINT=FALSE

          The  code  used  for  the  ASA_TEST  problem  closely follows the
     reference given in asa_usr.c, and was rewritten from code given to the
     author in 1992.  Other researchers have sent the author different code
     for this system, and all results agree within round-off errors.

          However, note that the actual problem stated in the reference  in
     asa_usr.c is harder, requiring the finding of an optimal point and not
     an optimal region.  The code for that problem is  given  in  asa_usr.c
     when  ASA_TEST_POINT  is  set  to  TRUE  (having the effect of setting
     COST_FILE      to      FALSE       in       asa_usr_asa.h).        The
     http://www.ingber.com/asa_examples.txt   file   illustrates  how  that
     global minimum can be attained.

     9.1.26.  MY_TEMPLATE=TRUE

          When MY_TEMPLATE is set  to  TRUE  (the  default),  locations  in
     asa_usr.c  and  asa_usr_asa.h  become  active sites for your own code.
     Searching asa_usr.c for "MY_TEMPLATE_" provides a guide for additional
     code  to  add  for  your  own  system.   For  example,  just above the
     occurrence of the guides for  MY_TEMPLATE_cost  is  the  corresponding
     code  for ASA_TEST=TRUE.  Keeping the default of ASA_TEST set to FALSE
     permits such changes without overwriting the test example.

     9.1.27.  USER_INITIAL_COST_TEMP=FALSE

          Setting USER_INITIAL_COST_TEMP to TRUE permits you to specify the
     initial  cost temperature in the User_Cost_Temperature [] array.  This
     can be useful in problems where you want to  start  the  search  at  a
     specific scale.

     9.1.28.  RATIO_TEMPERATURE_SCALES=FALSE

          Different   rates   of   parameter  annealing  can  be  set  with
     RATIO_TEMPERATURE_SCALES set to TRUE.  This requires initializing  the
     User_Temperature_Ratio [] array in the user module as discussed below.

     9.1.29.  USER_INITIAL_PARAMETERS_TEMPS=FALSE

          Setting  USER_INITIAL_PARAMETERS_TEMPS  to  TRUE  permits  you to
     specify    the    initial    parameter     temperatures     in     the
     User_Parameter_Temperature   []   array.    This   can  be  useful  in
     constrained problems, where greater  efficiency  can  be  achieved  in
     focussing the search than might be permitted just by setting upper and
     lower bounds.

     9.1.30.  DELTA_PARAMETERS=FALSE

          Different  increments,  used  during  reannealing  to  set   each
     parameter's  numerical  derivatives,  can be set with DELTA_PARAMETERS
     set to TRUE.  This requires initializing the  User_Delta_Parameter  []
     array in the user module as discussed below.

     9.1.31.  QUENCH_PARAMETERS=FALSE

          This  DEFINE_OPTIONS  permits you to alter the basic algorithm to
     perform selective "quenching," i.e., faster temperature  cooling  than
     permitted  by  the  ASA  algorithm.  This can be very useful, e.g., to
     quench the system down to some region of interest, and then to perform
     proper annealing for the rest of the run.  However, note that once you
     decide to quench rather than to truly anneal, there no longer  is  any
     statistical guarantee of finding a global optimum.

          Once  you  decide you can quench, there are many more alternative
     algorithms you might wish to choose for your system, e.g., creating  a
     hybrid  global-local  adaptive quenching search algorithm, e.g., using
     USER_REANNEAL_PARAMETERS described below.  Note that  just  using  the
     quenching  OPTIONS  provided  with  ASA  can  be  quite  powerful,  as

     demonstrated in the http://www.ingber.com/asa_examples.txt file.

          Setting QUENCH_PARAMETERS to TRUE can be extremely useful in very
     large  parameter  dimensions; see the ASA-NOTES file under the section
     on Quenching.   As  discussed  in  the  first  1989  VFSR  paper,  the
     heuristic  statistical  proof of finding the global optimum reduces to
     the following: The parameter temperature  schedules  must  suffice  to
     insure that the product of individual generating distributions,
             g = PROD_i g^i,
     taken at all annealing times, indexed by k, of not generating a global
     optimum, given infinite time, is such that
             PROD_k (1-g_k) = 0,
     which is equivalent to
             SUM_k g_k = infinity.
     For the ASA temperature schedule, this is satisfied as
             SUM_k PROD^D 1/k^(1/D) = SUM_k 1/k = infinity.
     Now, if the temperature schedule above is redefined as
             T_i(k_i) = T_0i exp(-c_i k_i^(Q/D)),
             c_i = m_i exp(-n_i Q/D),
     in terms of the "quenching factor" Q, then the above proof fails if  Q
     > 1 as
             SUM_k PROD^D 1/k^(Q/D) = SUM_k 1/k^Q < infinity

          This  simple  calculation shows how the "curse of dimensionality"
     arises, and also gives a possible way  of  living  with  this  disease
     which  will be present in any algorithm that substantially samples the
     parameter space.  In ASA, the influence of  large  dimensions  becomes
     clearly focused on the exponential of the power of k being 1/D, as the
     annealing required to properly sample the space becomes  prohibitively
     slow.   So, if we cannot commit resources to properly sample the space
     ergodically, then for some systems perhaps  the  next  best  procedure
     would  be  to  turn on quenching, whereby Q can become on the order of
     the size of number of dimensions.  In some cases tried, a small system
     of  only  a  few  parameters  can be used to determine some reasonable
     Program Options, and then these can be used for a  much  larger  space
     scaled  up to many parameters.  This can work in some cases because of
     the independence of dimension of the generating functions.

          If QUENCH_PARAMETERS is  TRUE,  then  User_Quench_Param_Scale  []
     must be defined as described below.

          If  OPTIONS_FILE_DATA,  QUENCH_COST,  and  QUENCH_PARAMETERS  are
     TRUE, then *User_Quench_Cost_Scale and User_Quench_Param_Scale []  all
     are  read  in  from asa_opt.  If RECUR_OPTIONS_FILE_DATA, QUENCH_COST,
     and  QUENCH_PARAMETERS  are  TRUE,  then  *User_Quench_Cost_Scale  and
     User_Quench_Param_Scale [] all are read in from asa_opt_recur.

     9.1.32.  QUENCH_COST=FALSE

          If  QUENCH_COST  is  set  to  TRUE, the scale of the power of 1/D
     temperature schedule used for the acceptance function can  be  altered
     in a similar fashion to that described above when QUENCH_PARAMETERS is
     set to TRUE.  However, note that this  OPTIONS  does  not  affect  the
     annealing  proof  of ASA, and so this may be used without damaging the

     statistical ergodicity of  the  algorithm.   Even  greater  functional
     changes   can   be   made   using   the   Pre-Compile   DEFINE_OPTIONS
     USER_COST_SCHEDULE, USER_ACCEPT_ASYMP_EXP,  USER_ACCEPT_THRESHOLD,  or
     USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST.

          If  QUENCH_COST  is TRUE, then User_Quench_Cost_Scale [0] must be
     defined as described below.

          If   OPTIONS_FILE_DATA   and   QUENCH_COST   are    TRUE,    then
     User_Quench_Cost_Scale    []    is   read   in   from   asa_opt.    If
     RECUR_OPTIONS_FILE_DATA    and    QUENCH_COST    are    TRUE,     then
     *User_Quench_Cost_Scale is read in from asa_opt_recur.

          Similarly   as   noted   above   for  QUENCH_PARAMETERS,  setting
     QUENCH_COST to TRUE can be extremely useful in  very  large  parameter
     dimensions; see the ASA-NOTES file under the section on Quenching.

     9.1.33.  QUENCH_PARAMETERS_SCALE=TRUE

          When  QUENCH_PARAMETERS  is  TRUE,  if QUENCH_PARAMETERS_SCALE is
     TRUE, then the temperature scales  and  the  temperature  indexes  are
     affected  by User_Quench_Param_Scale [].  This can have the effects of
     User_Quench_Param_Scale [] appear contrary,  as  the  effects  on  the
     temperatures  from  the temperature scales and the temperature indexes
     can have opposing effects.  However, these defaults are  perhaps  most
     intuitive  when the User_Quench_Param_Scale [] are on the order of the
     parameter dimension.

          When QUENCH_PARAMETERS is  TRUE,  if  QUENCH_PARAMETERS_SCALE  is
     FALSE,    only    the    temperature    indexes    are   affected   by
     User_Quench_Param_Scale [].  The  same  effect  could  be  managed  by
     raising  Temperature_Anneal_Scale  to  the appropriate power, but this
     may not be as convenient.

     9.1.34.  QUENCH_COST_SCALE=TRUE

          When QUENCH_COST is TRUE, if QUENCH_COST_SCALE is TRUE, then  the
     temperature   scale   and   the  temperature  index  are  affected  by
     User_Quench_Cost_Scale  [0].    This   can   have   the   effects   of
     User_Quench_Cost_Scale  [0]  appear  contrary,  as  the effects on the
     temperature from the temperature scale and the temperature  index  can
     have  opposing  effects.   However,  these  defaults  are perhaps most
     intuitive when User_Quench_Cost_Scale [0]  is  on  the  order  of  the
     parameter dimension.

          When QUENCH_COST is TRUE, if QUENCH_COST_SCALE is FALSE, only the
     temperature index is affected by User_Quench_Cost_Scale [0].  The same
     effect  could  be  managed  by raising Temperature_Anneal_Scale to the
     appropriate power, but this may not be as convenient.

     9.1.35.  ASA_TEMPLATE=FALSE

          There are several templates that come  with  the  ASA  code.   To
     permit  use  of  these  OPTIONS  without  having to delete these extra



                                     - 22 -





     Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)                       Lester Ingber


     tests, these templates are wrapped with ASA_TEMPLATE's.  To  use  your
     own cost function, you likely will only have to write cost_function ()
     in asa_usr_cst.c, and use the asa_opt file.  If you wish to  add  more
     OPTIONS   or  code,  you  may  need  to  write  relevant  portions  of
     cost_function  ()  and  initialize_parameters  ()  in  asa_usr.c   and
     asa_usr.h.

          The ASA-Makefile has several examples of DEFINE_OPTIONS that will
     generate test examples  using  special  ASA_TEMPLATE's  set  to  TRUE.
     These       are      {ASA_TEMPLATE_LIB,      ASA_TEMPLATE_ASA_OUT_PID,
     ASA_TEMPLATE_MULTIPLE,   ASA_TEMPLATE_SELFOPT,    ASA_TEMPLATE_SAMPLE,
     ASA_TEMPLATE_QUEUE,   ASA_TEMPLATE_PARALLEL,  ASA_TEMPLATE_SAVE};  the
     sets of Pre-Compile OPTIONS these use are defined in asa_usr_asa.h.

          Lines marked off by ASA_TEMPLATE, with no additional suffix,  are
     for  specific examples only.  ASA_TEMPLATE, with no suffix, should not
     be set to TRUE, else all groups of these examples will be brought into
     the code, likely not what is wanted.

     9.1.36.  OPTIONAL_DATA_DBL=FALSE

          It  can  be  useful  to return/pass additional information to the
     user module from/through the asa module.   When  OPTIONAL_DATA_DBL  is
     set  to TRUE, an additional Program Option pointer, *Asa_Data_Dbl, and
     its  dimension,  Asa_Data_Dim_Dbl,  are  available   in   USER_DEFINES
     *USER_OPTIONS to gather such data.

          In  the  ASA_TEMPLATE_SELFOPT  example  provided  (see the set of
     DEFINE_OPTIONS  used  in  asa_usr_asa.h),  OPTIONAL_DATA_DBL  is  used
     together  with  SELF_OPTIMIZE to find the set of ASA parameters giving
     the (statistically) smallest number of generated points to  solve  the
     ASA  test problem, assuming this were run several times with different
     random seeds for randflt in asa_usr.c.  Here, Asa_Data_Dbl [0] is used
     as  a  flag  to  print  out  Asa_Data_Dbl  [1]  in  asa_usr.c,  set to
     *best_number_generated_saved in asa.c.

          If    ASA_PARALLEL    is    TRUE,    then     N_Generated     and
     *best_number_generated_saved will only be accurate within the scale of
     OPTIONS->Gener_Block, as these are updated in the acceptance function.

     9.1.37.  OPTIONAL_DATA_INT=FALSE

          It can be useful to return/pass additional integer information to
     the  user  module from/through the asa module.  When OPTIONAL_DATA_INT
     is set to TRUE, an additional Program Option  pointer,  *Asa_Data_Int,
     and  its  dimension,  Asa_Data_Dim_Int,  are available in USER_DEFINES
     *USER_OPTIONS to gather such data.

     9.1.38.  OPTIONAL_DATA_PTR=FALSE

          It can be useful to return/pass  additional  array  or  structure
     information  to  the user module from/through the asa module (possibly
     containing other structures, e.g., useful when SELF_OPTIMIZE is TRUE).
     When  OPTIONAL_DATA_PTR  is  set to TRUE, an additional Program Option



                                     - 23 -





     Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)                       Lester Ingber


     pointer,  *Asa_Data_Ptr,  and  its  dimension,  Asa_Data_Dim_Ptr,  are
     available in USER_DEFINES *USER_OPTIONS to gather such data.  The type
     of   *Asa_Data_Dim_Ptr   is   a    pre-compile    OPTIONS    set    by
     OPTIONAL_PTR_TYPE.     See   examples   under   Asa_Data_Dim_Ptr   and
     Asa_Data_Ptr.

          If OPTIONAL_DATA_PTR is being used for RECUR_USER_OPTIONS as well
     as  for  USER_OPTIONS, you need not create (or free) additional memory
     in recur_cost_function() for Asa_Data_Dim_Ptr and Asa_Data_Ptr  to  be
     passed to the inner cost_function(), but rather link pointers to those
     in RECUR_USER_OPTIONS.  In asa_usr.c, there are guidelines to set "#if
     TRUE"  to "#if FALSE" at these points of the code.  This is the proper
     technique to use if ASA_SAVE, ASA_SAVE_OPT, or ASA_SAVE_BACKUP is  set
     to  TRUE  (since  data  is  saved  by  asa() depending on the level of
     recursion)..

          If ASA_SAVE, ASA_SAVE_OPT, and ASA_SAVE_BACKUP  are  not  set  to
     TRUE,  then  multiple  levels  of  recursion  can  each have their own
     defined information indexed to different  elements  of  the  array  of
     structures of size Asa_Data_Dim_Ptr.

          The  http://www.ingber.com/asa_examples.txt  file  contains  some
     guidance of the use of OPTIONAL_DATA_PTR and Asa_Data_Ptr.

     9.1.39.  OPTIONAL_PTR_TYPE=USER_TYPE

          When OPTIONAL_DATA_PTR is set to TRUE, the type of  *Asa_Data_Ptr
     is  a pre-compile OPTIONS set by OPTIONAL_PTR_TYPE, e.g., changing the
     label USER_TYPE in asa_usr_asa.h.  Be sure to place  any  non-standard
     types,   like   your   own   typedef   struct,   before   the  #define
     OPTIONAL_PTR_TYPE  at  the  top  of  asa_usr_asa.h,  e.g.,  under  #if
     MY_TEMPLATE    (since    OPTIONAL_PTR_TYPE    is   tested   below   in
     asa_usr_asa.h).  See the discussion under Asa_Data_Ptr.

     9.1.40.  USER_COST_SCHEDULE=FALSE

          The  function  used  to  control  the  cost_function  temperature
     schedule  is  of the form test_temperature in asa.c.  If the user sets
     the Pre-Compile DEFINE_OPTIONS USER_COST_SCHEDULE to TRUE,  then  this
     function of test_temperature can be controlled, adaptively if desired,
     in asa_usr.c in Cost_Schedule () (and  in  recur_Cost_Schedule  ()  if
     SELF_OPTIMIZE  is  TRUE)  by  setting USER_COST_SCHEDULE to TRUE.  The
     names of these functions are set to the relevant pointer in asa_usr.c,
     and can be changed if desired, i.e.,
        USER_OPTIONS->Cost_Schedule = user_cost_schedule;
        RECUR_USER_OPTIONS->Cost_Schedule = recur_user_cost_schedule;

     9.1.41.  USER_ACCEPT_ASYMP_EXP=FALSE

          When  USER_ACCEPT_ASYMP_EXP  is  TRUE,  an asymptotic form of the
     exponential function as  an  alternative  to  the  Boltzmann  function
     becomes    available   for   the   acceptance   test.    A   parameter
     OPTIONS->Asymp_Exp_Param becomes available, with a default of  1.0  in
     asa_usr.c  giving  the  standard Boltzmann function.  If you require a



                                     - 24 -





     Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)                       Lester Ingber


     more moderate acceptance test, then negative  Asymp_Exp_Param  may  be
     helpful.

     9.1.42.  USER_ACCEPT_THRESHOLD=FALSE

          When  USER_ACCEPT_THRESHOLD is TRUE, a  simple alternative to the
     Boltzmann function becomes available for the acceptance  test,  simply
     defining the probability of acceptance to be 1 if
             C(p_k+1) - C(p_k) <= T_cost,
     and 0 otherwise.

     9.1.43.  USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST=FALSE

          If  the Pre-Compile DEFINE_OPTIONS USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST is set to
     TRUE, the Boltzmann test probability function used in  the  acceptance
     criteria  in asa.c can be changed, adaptively if desired, in asa_usr.c
     in user_acceptance_test () (and in  recur_user_acceptance_test  ()  if
     SELF_OPTIMIZE  is  TRUE).  The names of these functions are set to the
     relevant pointer in asa_usr.c, and can be changed if desired, i.e.,

          If both USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST and USER_ACCEPT_ASYMP_EXP are set to
     TRUE,  then  the  default  OPTIONS->Asymp_Exp_Param = 1 can be used in
     asa_usr.c to duplicate  the  Boltzmann  test  in  asa.c,  e.g.,  as  a
     template to further develop a new acceptance test.
        USER_OPTIONS->Acceptance_Test = user_acceptance_test;
        RECUR_USER_OPTIONS->Acceptance_Test = recur_user_acceptance_test;
     When  USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST is TRUE, then any random numbers needed for
     the acceptance criteria are generated in the user module instead of in
     the asa module.

          When   USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST   is  TRUE,  additional  OPTIONS  are
     available to modify the acceptance criteria,  either  after  the  cost
     function is calculated or during its calculation:
        USER_OPTIONS->User_Acceptance_Flag
        USER_OPTIONS->Cost_Acceptance_Flag
        USER_OPTIONS->Last_Cost
        USER_OPTIONS->Cost_Temp_Curr
        USER_OPTIONS->Cost_Temp_Init
        USER_OPTIONS->Cost_Temp_Scale
        USER_OPTIONS->Prob_Bias
        USER_OPTIONS->Random_Seed

          Failing  the  acceptance  test  is  not  equivalent  to  dropping
     generated states from consideration for testing  with  the  acceptance
     criteria,  e.g.,  if  they  fail some regional constraints.  asa () is
     designed so that User_Acceptance_Flag is set to TRUE prior to  calling
     the  cost  function  whenever  acceptance tests need not be performed,
     i.e., when using the cost function  to  generate  initial  conditions,
     when  being  used  to calculate derivatives, or when samples are being
     generated to calculate the cost temperature; otherwise it  is  set  to
     FALSE.   The  value  of  Cost_Acceptance_Flag  always  is set to FALSE
     before entering the cost function.

     Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)                       Lester Ingber


          When entering the acceptance function, if Cost_Acceptance_Flag is
     TRUE,  then  the value of USER_OPTIONS->User_Acceptance_Flag (assuming
     *valid_state_generated_flag is TRUE) calculated in  user_cost_function
     ()   determines   the   value  of  the  acceptance  test.   Otherwise,
     USER_OPTIONS->Acceptance_Test () is called to calculate the  value  of
     USER_OPTIONS->User_Acceptance_Flag.  Note that if the cost function is
     used to calculate the acceptance criteria, and it is acceptable (e.g.,
     also     *valid_state_generated_flag     is     TRUE),    then    both
     USER_OPTIONS->User_Acceptance_Flag                                 and
     USER_OPTIONS->Cost_Acceptance_Flag must be set to TRUE.

          For  example, this can be useful if during the calculation of the
     cost function, without having to proceed to the final  evaluation,  it
     becomes  clear  that the acceptance criteria will not be passed.  This
     might occur if the cost function is increasing during its  calculation
     and  an acceptance test is carried out using the uniform random number
     calculated at the top of the cost function.  The  partially  evaluated
     cost  function  can  be compared to the Last_Cost, using the Boltzmann
     criteria    or     whatever     criteria     is     established     in
     USER_OPTIONS->user_acceptance_test  ().   Then  it  is  clear that the
     acceptance criteria will not be met (of course after checking that any
     constraints are met and setting *valid_state_generated_flag to TRUE if
     so), then USER_OPTIONS->User_Acceptance_Flag can be set to or left  at
     FALSE,   and  then  proceed  to  return  to  asa ().   However,  other
     information registered in the  acceptance  function  still  should  be
     calculated,  e.g.,  updating  indices, information used for ASA_SAMPLE
     and ASA_PARALLEL, etc.

     9.1.44.  USER_GENERATING_FUNCTION=FALSE

          The ASA generating probability function in asa.c can  be  changed
     if     the     user     sets     the     Pre-Compile    DEFINE_OPTIONS
     USER_GENERATING_FUNCTION to TRUE; then this function can  be  changed,
     adaptively if desired, in asa_usr.c in user_generating_distrib () (and
     in recur_user_generating_distrib  ()  if  SELF_OPTIMIZE  is  TRUE)  by
     setting   USER_GENERATING_FUNCTION   to  TRUE.   The  names  of  these
     functions are set to the relevant pointer in  asa_usr.c,  and  can  be
     changed if desired, i.e.,
        USER_OPTIONS->Generating_Distrib = user_generating_distrib;
        RECUR_USER_OPTIONS->Generating_Distrib                            =
        recur_user_generating_distrib;
     The parameters passed to these functions are further described below.

          Several parameters additional  to  those  required  for  the  ASA
     distribution  are  passed  to  make  it easier to install other common
     distributions.  Note that range checks take place at  multiple  stages
     of search, so be sure your chosen ranges can take this into account.

     9.1.45.  USER_REANNEAL_COST=FALSE

          In asa.c reannealing of the cost temperature is determined by the
     algorithm described  above  in  the  section  Reannealing  Temperature

     Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)                       Lester Ingber


          If    the    user    sets    the    Pre-Compile    DEFINE_OPTIONS
     USER_REANNEAL_COST to TRUE, while Reanneal_Cost is not 0 or  -1,  then
     the  function  controlling  the new reannealed cost temperature can be
     controlled, adaptively if desired using USER_OPTIONS, in asa_usr.c  in
     user_reanneal_cost   (),   and   in   recur_user_reanneal_cost  ()  if
     SELF_OPTIMIZE is TRUE.  The names of these functions are  set  to  the
     relevant pointer in asa_usr.c, and can be changed if desired, i.e.,
        USER_OPTIONS->Reanneal_Cost_Function = user_reanneal_cost;
        RECUR_USER_OPTIONS->Reanneal_Cost_Function                        =
        recur_user_reanneal_cost;
     In   these   functions,   the   variables   *current_cost_temperature,
     *initial_cost_temperature,  and  the best and last saved cost function
     can be altered, and the  returned  integer  value  of  TRUE  or  FALSE
     determines  whether to use the best saved cost function as the current
     cost temperature.

          Since  these   functions   can   be   called   every   value   of
     Acceptance_Frequency_Modulus, Generated_Frequency_Modulus, or when the
     ratio   of   accepted   to   generated    points    is    less    than
     Accepted_To_Generated_Ratio,  this  opportunity  also  can  be used to
     adaptively change other OPTIONS.  This can be very useful for  systems
     where  the  scales  of the acceptance criteria do not simply correlate
     the cost temperature with the current best value of the cost function.

          For example, this function could be used when the last saved cost
     function  is  so  close  to  zero  that the effect would be to set the
     *initial_cost_temperature to that value, but the best  value  for  the
     cost  function  is known to be less than zero.  (An alternative moving
     average example is given in asa_usr.c.)  Other alternatives are to use
     USER_REANNEAL_COST  with  default FALSE and Reanneal_Cost > 1 or < -1,
     as described below.

     9.1.46.  USER_REANNEAL_PARAMETERS=FALSE

          In asa.h, the macro
        #define \
          FUNCTION_REANNEAL_PARAMS(temperature, tangent, max_tangent) \
           (temperature * (max_tangent / tangent))
     is used to determine the new temperature, subject to further tests  in
     reanneal  ().   This  is  the  default  if USER_REANNEAL_PARAMETERS is
     FALSE.

          If    the    user    sets    the    Pre-Compile    DEFINE_OPTIONS
     USER_REANNEAL_PARAMETERS  to  TRUE,  then the function controlling the
     new reannealed temperature can be controlled,  adaptively  if  desired
     using  USER_OPTIONS,  in  asa_usr.c in user_reanneal_params (), and in
     recur_user_reanneal_params () if SELF_OPTIMIZE is TRUE.  The names  of
     these  functions are set to the relevant pointer in asa_usr.c, and can
     be changed if desired, i.e.,
        USER_OPTIONS->Reanneal_Params_Function = user_reanneal_params;
        RECUR_USER_OPTIONS->Reanneal_Params_Function                      =
        recur_user_reanneal_params;

     Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)                       Lester Ingber


          Since  FUNCTION_REANNEAL_PARAMS  ()  can be called every value of
     Acceptance_Frequency_Modulus, Generated_Frequency_Modulus, or when the
     ratio    of    accepted    to    generated   points   is   less   than
     Accepted_To_Generated_Ratio, this opportunity  also  can  be  used  to
     adaptively    change    other    OPTIONS.    For   example,   if   the
     QUENCH_PARAMETERS OPTIONS is set to TRUE, as discussed above,  it  may
     useful  to  create  a  hybrid  global-local  adaptive quenching search
     algorithm.

     9.1.47.  MAXIMUM_REANNEAL_INDEX=50000

          The  maximum  index  (number  of  steps)  at  which  the  initial
     temperature  and  the  index  of the temperature are rescaled to avoid
     losing machine precision.  ASA typically is quite insensitive  to  the
     value used due to the dual rescaling.

     9.1.48.  REANNEAL_SCALE=10.0

          The   reannealing   scale  used  when  MAXIMUM_REANNEAL_INDEX  is
     exceeded.

     9.1.49.  ASA_SAMPLE=FALSE

          When ASA_SAMPLE is set to TRUE, data is collected by  ASA  during
     its  global  optimization  process  to  importance-sample  the  user's
     variables.  Four OPTIONS become available  to  monitor  the  sampling:
     Bias_Acceptance, *Bias_Generated, Average_Weights, and Limit_Weights.

          If  Average_Weights  exceeds  the user's choice of Limit_Weights,
     then the ASA_OUT file will contain  additional  detailed  information,
     including  temperatures  and  biases  for  each current parameter.  To
     facilitate extracting importance-sampled  information  from  the  file
     printed  out by the asa module, all relevant lines start with :SAMPLE[
     |:|#|+].  A sample () function in asa_usr.c  illustrates  the  use  of
     these tags.

          Many Monte Carlo sampling techniques require the user to guess an
     appropriately decreasing "window" to sample the variable  space.   The
     fat  tail of the ASA generating function, and the decreasing effective
     range of newly accepted  points  driven  by  exponentially  decreasing
     temperature schedules, removes this arbitrary aspect of such sampling.

          However,   note  that,  albeit  local  optima  are  sampled,  the
     efficiency of ASA optimization most often leads to  poor  sampling  in
     regions  whose  cost function is far from the optimal point; many such
     points may be important contributions to  algorithms  like  integrals.
     Accordingly, ASA_SAMPLE likely is best used to explore new regions and
     new systems.

          To increase the sampling rate and thereby  to  possibly  increase
     the  accuracy  of  this  algorithm,  use  one  or a combination of the
     various OPTIONS available for slowing down the annealing performed  by
     ASA.   However, the selected OPTIONS still must yield good convergence
     if the optimal region is to be properly sampled.

     Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)                       Lester Ingber


     9.1.50.  ADAPTIVE_OPTIONS=FALSE

          When ADAPTIVE_OPTIONS is set to TRUE, it is  possible  to  change
     relevant  OPTIONS  in  the USER_DEFINES struct in asa_usr_asa.h during
     run time, by including an asa_adaptive_options file.  This can be very
     useful to efficiently determine how to tune long runs.

          The  function  call  to  adaptive_options(USER_OPTIONS) should be
     placed at the top of your cost function.  Some examples of the  format
     of  lines  in  the comma-delimited asa_adaptive_options file are given
     just above the adaptive_options function in asa_usr.c.

     9.1.51.  ASA_QUEUE=FALSE

          When ASA_QUEUE is set to TRUE, a first-in first-out (FIFO) queue,
     of size USER_OPTIONS->Queue_Size, is used to collect generated states.
     When a new state is  generated,  its  parameters  are  tested,  within
     specified   resolutions   of  USER_OPTIONS->Queue_Resolution  []  (the
     absolute values of each of the differences between the  parameters  of
     the  current  generated  state and those in the queue).  If a previous
     state is already represented, then  the  stored  values  of  the  cost
     function  and  the cost flag are returned, instead of calling the cost
     function again.  Note that the size of the array required to store the
     queued  parameters  is  Queue_Size times the number of parameters, and
     this can consume a lot of CPU time as well as storage, so this OPTIONS
     is  only  useful for cost functions that are themselves very costly to
     evaluate.  Setting ASA_TEMPLATE_QUEUE to  TRUE  will  run  an  example
     using the ASA_TEST problem.

          The  ASA_QUEUE  DEFINE_OPTIONS also can be used to coarse-grain a
     fit,  by  setting  high  values  of  Queue_Resolution  [].   Note  the
     difference   between   the   operations  of  this  DEFINE_OPTIONS  and
     ASA_RESOLUTION.

          If  ASA_QUEUE  is  TRUE  and  ASA_RESOLUTION  is  FALSE,  machine
     precision  is used for type double variables, the queue is created and
     subsequent variables are tested against this queue.  If ASA_RESOLUTION
     and  ASA_QUEUE  are  both TRUE, then the Coarse_Resolution [] array is
     used for Queue_Resolution [], ASA_RESOLUTION is enforced from the very
     first  call to the cost function, and the queue is created using these
     coarse variables.

          The default in asa.c for the FIFO  queue  uses  a  simple  search
     among  stored  parameter  values,  under  the assumption that for most
     complex systems for which ASA_QUEUE=TRUE is useful, the bottleneck  is
     in  the  evaluation  of  the cost functions.  If you think this is not
     true for you, and you need to conserve CPU time in  using  lists,  the
     http://www.ingber.com/asa_contrib.txt   file   gives  code  that  uses
     doubly-linked and hashed lists.

          If ASA_QUEUE and ASA_PRINT_MORE are TRUE then, whenever a  queued
     cost function is used, this is recorded in asa_out.

     Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)                       Lester Ingber


          When  ASA_QUEUE  is  TRUE, then the value of *cost_flag is tested
     for FALSE in previous states in queue  and  an  invalid  statement  is
     available in the printout.

     9.1.52.  ASA_RESOLUTION=FALSE

          When  ASA_RESOLUTION is set to TRUE, parameters are resolved to a
     user-defined resolution  set  in  USER_OPTIONS->Coarse_Resolution  [],
     i.e.,  within  plus or minus the values of Coarse_Resolution [].  This
     is performed as soon as  candidate  values  are  generated,  for  each
     parameter  for  which Coarse_Resolution [] is greater than zero.  Note
     the difference between the operations of this OPTIONS and ASA_QUEUE.

          If  ASA_QUEUE  is  TRUE  and  ASA_RESOLUTION  is  FALSE,  machine
     precision  is used for type double variables, the queue is created and
     subsequent variables are tested against this queue.  If ASA_RESOLUTION
     and  ASA_QUEUE  are  both TRUE, then the Coarse_Resolution [] array is
     used for Queue_Resolution [], ASA_RESOLUTION is enforced from the very
     first  call to the cost function, and the queue is created using these
     coarse variables.

          When USER_OPTIONS->Coarse_Resolution [] is > 0 and parameter_type
     []  is  >  0  (specifying  an integer parameter), ASA_RESOLUTION takes
     precedence over  parameter_type  []  when  calculating  new  generated
     parameters.

     9.1.53.  ASA_FUZZY=FALSE

          When  ASA_FUZZY  is set to TRUE, a modified fuzzy-logic algorithm
     originally developed by Hime Junior performs  an  adaptive  tuning  of
     selected  ASA  OPTIONS.   ASA_FUZZY  has  several  adaptive parameters
     defined in asa_usr_asa.h, and some fixed  #define  parameters  in  the
     several subroutines at the bottom of asa_usr.c.  The default functions
     are set to tune QUENCH_COST and QUENCH_PARAMETERS parameters, so these
     are tested to be TRUE in the default asa_usr_asa.h.  If you change any
     defaults, pay attention to  sections  labeled  ASA_FUZZY  at  top  and
     bottom sections of asa_usr.c and asa_usr.h.

          Initial       QUENCH       settings       are       saved      in
     *ASA_FUZZY_Init_User_Quench_Param_Scale                            and
     *ASA_FUZZY_Init_User_Quench_Cost_Scale  which  may  be used to restore
     regular annealing schedules under some conditions. In  asa_usr.c  they
     can be reset by the user, e.g., to 1.0, etc.

          Often  ASA_FUZZY  will turn on QUENCHing > 1, violating the proof
     of ASA, as discussed above.  For many systems, this speeding up of the
     sampling  process  can  be  a  welcome efficiency, but in some systems
     global minima may be missed, e.g., in systems with multiple scales.

     9.1.54.  ASA_FUZZY_PRINT=FALSE

          When ASA_FUZZY is set to TRUE, if ASA_FUZZY_PRINT is  TRUE,  then
     notifications   will  be  printed  out  from  FuzzyControl  ()  and/or
     AlterQuench () in the user module.

     9.1.55.  FITLOC=FALSE

          When FITLOC is set to TRUE, three subroutines  become  active  to
     perform a local fit after leaving asa ().  This can be useful to shunt
     asa () to a local code after the region of the  global  fit  is  known
     with some confidence, which many times is an efficient procedure.

          Any  robust quasi-linear optimization code may work well for this
     purpose.  To illustrate  this  procedure,  the  user  module  contains
     fitloc  ()  which  sets  up the calls to simplex ().  simplex () calls
     calcf () which calls cost_function (), and adds  USER_OPTIONS->Penalty
     whenever  simplex  ()  asks  for  parameters  out  of  ranges  of  the
     parameters or whenever a constraint in cost_function () is violated.

          ASA parameters, the OPTIONS, are raised to a high level  of  view
     for direct control by the user.  However, most optimization codes have
     their own parameters that may  not  be  apparent  to  the  user.   For
     example,  fitloc () calls simplex () which contains parameters such as
     {tol1, tol2, no_progress, alpha, beta1, beta2, gamma,  delta,  iters}.
     Many  problems will require tuning of these parameters to achieve good
     results just from this simplex () algorithm.

          USER_OPTIONS->Fit_Local is  passed  to  cost_function  ().   This
     provides  additional flexibility in deciding when to shunt asa () over
     to fitloc  (),  e.g.,  during  multiple  or  recursive  optimizations.
     USER_OPTIONS->Iter_Max   determines  the  maximum  iterations  of  the
     cost_function () by simplex ().  USER_OPTIONS->Penalty determines  how
     to weight violation of constraints, exceeding boundaries, etc.

     9.1.56.  FITLOC_ROUND=TRUE

          If FITLOC is set to TRUE and FITLOC_ROUND is TRUE, then each time
     parameters are passed to or between the local  routines,  simplex  (),
     calcf (), and fitloc (), they are first processed by rounding integers
     or respecting rounding according to ASA_RESOLUTION  constraints  prior
     to any further calculations.  I.e., all values of a parameter within a
     given resolution are considered to be equivalent for  calculating  the
     cost function.

     9.1.57.  FITLOC_PRINT=TRUE

          When  FITLOC  is  set  to  TRUE,  if  FITLOC_PRINT  is TRUE, then
     intermediate calculations will be  printed  out  from  fitloc  ()  and
     simplex () in the user module.

     9.1.58.  MULTI_MIN=FALSE

          When     MULTI_MIN     is     set    to    TRUE,    the    lowest
     USER_OPTIONS->Multi_Number values of the cost function, determined  to
     be  the  best-generated  during  the  sampling  process,  of  the cost
     function and their parameters are saved.  These can be read  out  just
     after   asa   ()  returns  after  its  fit.   The  pre-compile  number
     USER_OPTIONS->Multi_Number and  OPTIONS  *Multi_Cost,  **Multi_Params,
     *Multi_Grid, and Multi_Specify become available.  In asa_usr.c, memory

     Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)                       Lester Ingber


     for           the           arrays            USER_OPTIONS->Multi_Cost
     [USER_OPTIONS->Multi_Number][*parameter_dimension],
     USER_OPTIONS->Multi_Params
     [USER_OPTIONS->Multi_Number][*parameter_dimension],                and
     USER_OPTIONS->Multi_Grid [*parameter_dimension] are  set.   Multi_Grid
     values  must  be  set  by the user, but may be overridden as explained
     below under USER_OPTIONS->Multi_Grid.

          If OPTIONS->Curvature_0 is FALSE, all  USER_OPTIONS->Multi_Number
     tangents  and  curvatures are calculated.  This can be useful for some
     calculations requiring the shapes of the local minima.

          This procedure  selects  local  minima  that  statistically  have
     maintained  some  quasi-stability  during  sampling.   Note  that this
     procedure  does  not  guarantee  that  the  USER_OPTIONS->Multi_Number
     lowest  sampled  values of the cost function will be saved, only those
     that were selected  to  be  the  best-generated  during  the  sampling
     process.

          If  OPTIONS->Multi_Specify  is  set  to 0, the selection of best-
     generated states includes all sampled instances of the cost functions.
     If OPTIONS->Multi_Specify is set to 1, the selection of best-generated
     states is constrained to include only those with different  values  of
     the cost function.

          The  http://www.ingber.com/asa_examples.txt  file  contains  some
     guidance of the use of MULTI_MIN (and Multi_[] OPTIONS).

     9.1.59.  ASA_PARALLEL=FALSE

          The parallelization procedure employed here does not destroy  the
     sampling  properties  of  ASA.   When  ASA_PARALLEL  is  set  to TRUE,
     parallel blocks of generated states are calculated of number equal  to
     the        minimum        of       USER_OPTIONS->Gener_Block       and
     USER_OPTIONS->Gener_Block_Max.   For   most   systems   with   complex
     nonlinear  cost  functions  that  require  the  fat  tail  of  the ASA
     distribution, leading to high generated to acceptance ratios, this  is
     the   most   CPU   intensive   part  of  ASA  that  can  benefit  from
     parallelization.

          USER_OPTIONS->Gener_Block is calculated as a moving average  over
     a  sample  of  USER_OPTIONS->Gener_Mov_Avr, of the previous numbers of
     generated states required to find a new best accepted state.   If  and
     when     USER_OPTIONS->Gener_Mov_Avr     is    set    to    0,    then
     USER_OPTIONS->Gener_Block is not changed thereafter.

          Each block of generated states is sorted  to  permit  the  lowest
     cost functions to pass first through the acceptance test.

          There  are  hooks  in  asa.c  to  spawn  off multiple processors.
     Parallel code should be inserted in asa.c between the lines:
        /* *** ENTER CODE TO SPAWN OFF PARALLEL GENERATED STATES *** */
        ...
        /* *** EXIT CODE SPAWNING OFF PARALLEL GENERATED STATES *** */

     Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)                       Lester Ingber


          The ASA_TEMPLATE_PARALLEL example given in asa_usr.c  illustrates
     how  the  the USER_OPTIONS are set.  Note that since the random number
     generator is called  differently,  generating  some  extra  states  as
     described  above, the results are not identical to the serial ASA_TEST
     calculation.

          When ASA_PARALLEL is set to TRUE, the do  loop  around  generated
     states that tests for invalid states is taken over, not within, blocks
     of parallel calculated cost functions for these generated states.

          When ASA_PARALLEL is set to TRUE, code  in  ASA-MAKEFILE,  asa.c,
     asa_usr.c,  and asa_usr_asa.h is set to run under OpenMP using the gcc
     compiler; search for instances of _OPENMP.  Change/add lines  of  code
     to  correspond  to your choice of parallel algorithm and compiler. The
     entire ASA_PARALLEL section makes assignments to indexed variables  to
     afford flexibility for other such algorithms.

     When  ASA_PARALLEL  is  TRUE,  OPTIONS->parallel_id  is available just
     before the call to each user_cost_function(),  e.g.,  in  case  it  is
     needed  by the cost function or its own calls to other user functions.
     The default before any calls  within  the  SPAWN  block  in  asa.c  is
     parallel_id = -1.

     9.1.60.  FDLIBM_POW=FALSE

          When  FDLIBM_POW is set to TRUE, a user-defined function s_pow ()
     is used instead of pow ().  This may be  desirable  on  some  machines
     when    a    speed-up    can    be    realized.     Some    code    in
     http://www.ingber.com/asa_contrib.txt should first be tested with  the
     standard  ASA_TEST OPTIONS to see if the resulting asa_out file agrees
     with the asa_test_asa file.

     9.1.61.  FDLIBM_LOG=FALSE

          When FDLIBM_LOG is set to TRUE, a user-defined function s_log  ()
     is  used  instead  of  log ().  This may be desirable on some machines
     when    a    speed-up    can    be    realized.     Some    code    in
     http://www.ingber.com/asa_contrib.txt  should first be tested with the
     standard ASA_TEST OPTIONS to see if the resulting asa_out file  agrees
     with the asa_test_asa file.

     9.1.62.  FDLIBM_EXP=FALSE

          When  FDLIBM_EXP is set to TRUE, a user-defined function s_exp ()
     is used instead of exp ().  This may be  desirable  on  some  machines
     when    a    speed-up    can    be    realized.     Some    code    in
     http://www.ingber.com/asa_contrib.txt should first be tested with  the
     standard  ASA_TEST OPTIONS to see if the resulting asa_out file agrees
     with the asa_test_asa file.

     9.2.1.  USER_OUT=\"asa_usr_out\"

          The  name  of  the  output  file  containing  all  printing  from
     asa_usr.c.    If   you   wish   to   attach   a   process  number  use
     USER_OUT=\"asa_usr_out_$$\".   (Use  USER_OUT=\"asa_usr_out_$$$$\"  if
     this   is  set  in  the  ASA-Makefile.)  If  USER_OUT=\"STDOUT\"  then
     asa_usr.c will print to stdout.

     9.2.2.  USER_ASA_USR_OUT=FALSE

          When USER_ASA_USR_OUT is  set  to  TRUE,  an  additional  Program
     Option pointer, *Asa_Usr_Out_File, must be used to dynamically set the
     name(s) of  the  file(s)  printed  out  by  the  user  module.   (This
     overrides any USER_OUT settings.)

     9.2.3.  INCL_STDOUT=TRUE

          Some  compilers on some systems under some levels of optimization
     will not compile if "stdout" is present in the code.  All instances of
     "stdout" and "printf" in the user and the asa modules can be commented
     out by setting  INCL_STDOUT  to  FALSE.   Note  that  this  also  will
     suppress some output from such OPTIONS as ASA_PIPE, TIME_CALC, etc.

          The use of INCL_STDOUT set to FALSE is recommended for creating a
     DLL as described in the DLL ASA-Makefile sub-Section of Section 7.

     9.2.4.  ASA_PRINT=TRUE

          Setting this to FALSE will suppress all printing within asa.

     9.2.5.  ASA_OUT=\"asa_out\"

          The name of the output file containing all printing from asa.  If
     you  wish to attach a process number use ASA_OUT=\"asa_out_$$\".  (Use
     ASA_OUT=\"asa_out_$$$$\" if this  is  set  in  the  ASA-Makefile.)  If
     ASA_OUT=\"STDOUT\"  then ASA will print to stdout.  See the discussion
     of the use of ASA_TEMPLATE_ASA_OUT_PID  in  the  section  USER_ASA_OUT
     below to obtain multiple output files numbered according to the system
     pid.

     9.2.6.  USER_ASA_OUT=FALSE

          When USER_ASA_OUT is set to TRUE, an  additional  Program  Option
     pointer,  *Asa_Out_File, is used to dynamically set the name(s) of the
     file(s) printed out by the asa module.  (This  overrides  any  ASA_OUT
     settings.)   In  asa_usr.c, if USER_OPTIONS->Asa_Out_File = "STDOUT";,
     then ASA will print to stdout.

          In the ASA_TEMPLATE_MULTIPLE example provided  (see  the  set  of
     DEFINE_OPTIONS   used  in  asa_usr_asa.h),  USER_ASA_OUT  is  used  to
     generate multiple files of separate ASA runs.   (If  QUENCH_PARAMETERS
     and/or  QUENCH_COST  is  set  to TRUE, then this example will separate
     runs with different quenching values.)

          In the ASA_TEMPLATE_ASA_OUT_PID example provided (see the set  of
     DEFINE_OPTIONS   used  in  asa_usr_asa.h),  USER_ASA_OUT  is  used  to
     generate ASA_OUT files of the form asa_out__x and asa_usr_out_x, where
     x  is  the  system  pid.  This can be useful for a series of runs just
     changing parameters in asa_opt, getting different output files without
     recompiling.   Depending  on  your  system, you may have to change the
     include file and  the  prototype  of  getpid  ()  in  asa_usr.h  under
     ASA_TEMPLATE_ASA_OUT_PID,  and possibly the int declaration of pid_int
     in asa_usr.c.

     9.2.7.  ASA_PRINT_INTERMED=TRUE

          This option is only effective  if  ASA_PRINT  is  TRUE.   Setting
     ASA_PRINT_INTERMED  to  FALSE will suppress much intermediate printing
     within asa, especially arrays which can be large when  the  number  of
     parameters   is   large.    Printing   at   intermediate   stages   of
     testing/reannealing has been turned off when SELF_OPTIMIZE is  set  to
     TRUE,  since  there  likely can be quite a bit of data generated; this
     can be changed by explicitly setting ASA_PRINT_INTERMED to TRUE in the
     ASA-Makefile or on your compilation command lines.

     9.2.8.  ASA_PRINT_MORE=FALSE

          Setting  ASA_PRINT_MORE  to TRUE will print out more intermediate
     information, e.g., new parameters whenever a new minimum is  reported.
     As  is  the case whenever tangents are not calculated by choosing some
     ASA options, normally the intermediate values of tangents will not  be
     up to date.

          The  section  above,  Use of Documentation for Tuning, emphasizes
     the importance of using ASA_PRINT_MORE set to TRUE to  help  determine
     optimal tuning of ASA on specific problems.

     9.2.9.  G_FIELD=12 & G_PRECISION=7

          The field width and precision of doubles is specified in asa.c as
     G_FIELD.G_PRECISION,     e.g.,     as     %gG_FIELD.G_PRECISION     or
     %g-G_FIELD.G_PRECISION.    These   two   Printing  DEFINE_OPTIONS  are
     available to change the default of 12.7.

     9.2.10.  ASA_SAVE=FALSE

          When ASA_SAVE is set to TRUE, asa  saves  enough  information  in
     file  asa_save  after  each newly best accepted state, to restart from
     the point entering the main annealing loop, continue  thereafter  from
     the best accepted state in asa_save.  Of course, this use of I/O takes
     CPU  resources,  and  can  appreciably  slow  down  your  runs.   When
     SYSTEM_CALL  is  set  to TRUE, for extra protection, e.g., in case the
     run aborts during a write of asa_save, each time a  file  asa_save  is
     written, it also is copied to a new file asa_save.old.

          In  order  to store the whole block of random numbers used at any
     time,  the  number  USER  USER_OPTIONS->Random_Array_Dim   and   array
     USER_OPTIONS->Random_Array  are required.  These may be changed by the

     Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)                       Lester Ingber


     user in asa_usr.c for different random number generators and shuffling
     algorithms.   The  default  is to use SHUFFLE defined in asa_usr.h for
     Random_Array_Dim in the default random number generator in  asa_usr.c,
     and the pointer Random_Array is set to the pointer of the static array
     random_array at the top of asa_usr.c.

          Just restart the run by executing asa_run.  When ASA_SAVE is  set
     to TRUE, the existence of file asa_save is used to determine whether a
     new run or a rerun  is  to  proceed.   Therefore,  be  sure  your  ASA
     directory  does not have any old asa_save file present if a new run is
     to start.

          The asa_opt file is included just after asa_save files  are  read
     into  the  code.   Therefore, any new C code you wish to have override
     information read in from asa_save can be simply added to the bottom of
     asa_opt.   Be  sure you write the names of these variables as they are
     used in the asa.c file, which can differ from  their  counterparts  in
     asa_usr.c  file.   Some example are given at the end of asa_opt before
     the #endif statement.   Each  time  you  add  new  information  to  be
     compiled, be sure to enforce a new recompile of asa.c and asa_run.  In
     most cases this can be done simply by removing asa.o  before  using  a
     make  or  recompiling  the  executable.  However, see ASA_SAVE_OPT for
     changes that may be made without any recompilation.

          When  ASA  is  run   at   several   levels   of   recursion,   if
     USER_OPTIONS->Asa_Recursive_Level  is  properly  incremented from 0 at
     the innermost shell, the outermost shell at level n will create  files
     asa_save_{n}.

     9.2.11.  ASA_SAVE_OPT=FALSE


          When  ASA_SAVE_OPT  is set to TRUE, when asa is restarted, if the
     file asa_opt_save is present in the same directory  as  asa_opt,  then
     new   values   of  ASA  parameters  and  OPTIONS  are  read  in  after
     initializing to the point of the last writing of asa_save.

          No recompilation of the code is necessary, and only warnings  are
     issued  if  asa_save_opt is not present.  The file asa_save_opt should
     be created as an exact copy of asa_opt before  changes  in  values  of
     parameters  and OPTIONS are made.  When ASA_SAVE_OPT is TRUE, ASA_SAVE
     is automatically set to TRUE in asa_usr_asa.h.

     9.2.12.  ASA_SAVE_BACKUP=FALSE

          When ASA_SAVE_BACKUP is set to TRUE, asa saves enough information
     after    each   newly   best   accepted   state,   creating   a   file
     asa_save.{N_Accepted}, to enable the user to restart from any previous
     best  accepted  state  when  that  asa_save.{best_state}  is copied to
     asa_save.

          When used with  ASA_PIPE  and/or  ASA_PIPE_FILE,  ASA_SAVE_BACKUP
     permits  the  user  to  interactively  tune  the  optimization process
     without having to start new runs.  Read the above ASA_SAVE section  on

     Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)                       Lester Ingber


     the  use  of  the  asa_opt  file  to modify code before reading in the
     asa_save file.

          When ASA_SAVE_BACKUP is TRUE, ASA_SAVE is  automatically  set  to
     TRUE in asa_usr_asa.h.

          When   ASA   is   run   at   several   levels  of  recursion,  if
     USER_OPTIONS->Asa_Recursive_Level is properly incremented  from  0  at
     the  innermost shell, the outermost shell at level n will create files
     asa_save_{n}.{N_Accepted}.

     9.2.13.  ASA_PIPE=FALSE

          When ASA_PIPE is set to TRUE, asa prints to STDOUT lines of  data
     after  calls  to  the  cost  function,  which  can  be  used to update
     databases or graphs in real time.   This  information  is  {number  of
     valid generated states, number of accepted states, best cost function,
     best parameter values, current  cost  temperature,  current  parameter
     temperatures, last cost function}.

     9.2.14.  ASA_PIPE_FILE=FALSE

          When  ASA_PIPE_FILE  is set to TRUE, asa prints to asa_pipe lines
     of data that can be used to  examine  run  data.   This  can  be  used
     complementary to ASA_PIPE.

     9.2.15.  ASA_EXIT_ANYTIME=FALSE

          When  ASA_EXIT_ANYTIME  is  set  to TRUE, the first call to asa()
     creates the file asa_exit_anytime.  To  permit  IMMEDIATE_EXIT  before
     calculating   the   next  generated  state,  simply  delete  the  file
     asa_exit_anytime, and asa() will exit with code IMMEDIATE_EXIT.   This
     can be useful on long runs.

     9.2.16.  SYSTEM_CALL=TRUE

          When  SYSTEM_CALL  is set to FALSE, asa avoids popen () commands.
     This is useful on machines that do not  permit  these  commands.   For
     example, when ASA_SAVE is set to TRUE, asa uses a popen call in asa.c,
     to copy asa_save to  asa_save.old.   This  also  is  required  to  use
     ASA_SAVE_BACKUP set to TRUE.

          Note  that  two  ways  are  maintained  for  passing  the Program
     Options.  Check the  comments  in  the  ASA-NOTES  file.   It  may  be
     necessary  to  change  some of the options for some systems.  Read the
     http://www.ingber.com/asa_examples.txt   file   for    some    ongoing
     discussions  and  suggestions  on  how  to  try to optimally set these
     options.   Note  the  distinction   between   trying   to   speed   up
     annealing/quenching  versus  trying  to  slow  down  annealing  (which
     sometimes can speed up the search by avoiding spending too  much  time
     in  some  local  optimal  regions).   Templates  are  set up in ASA to
     accommodate all alternatives.  Below, the defaults are given in square
     brackets [].

     (A)  asa_usr.c file
          When  using  ASA as part of a large library, it likely is easiest
          to make these changes within the user  module,  e.g.,  using  the
          template  placed  in  asa_usr.c.  In the user module, the Program
          Options are stored in the  structure  USER_DEFINES  *USER_OPTIONS
          (and  in  USER_DEFINES  *RECUR_USER_OPTIONS  if  SELF_OPTIMIZE is
          TRUE).

     (B)  asa_opt file
          It likely is most efficient to use a separate data file  avoiding
          repeated  compilations  of the code, to test various combinations
          of  Program  Options,  e.g.,  using   the   file   asa_opt   when
          OPTIONS_FILE  and  OPTIONS_FILE_DATA  are  set  to  TRUE  in  the
          ASA-Makefile or on your compilation command lines.

          In the asa module (which can be called recursively) the structure
     is  called USER_DEFINES *OPTIONS.  For the rest of this file, where no
     confusion can reasonably arise, the Program Options will  be  referred
     to as USER_DEFINES *OPTIONS.

     9.3.1.  OPTIONS->Limit_Acceptances[10000]

          The  maximum  number of states accepted before quitting.  All the
     templates in ASA  have  been  set  to  use  Limit_Acceptances=1000  to
     illustrate the way these options can be changed.  If Limit_Acceptances
     is set to 0, then no limit is observed.  This can be useful  for  some
     systems that cannot handle large integers.

     9.3.2.  OPTIONS->Limit_Generated[99999]

          The  maximum  number  of  states  generated  before quitting.  If
     Limit_Generated is set to 0, then no limit is observed.  This  can  be
     useful for some systems that cannot handle large integers.

     9.3.3.  OPTIONS->Limit_Invalid_Generated_States[1000]

          This sets limits of repetitive invalid  generated  states,  e.g.,
     when  using  this  method  to  include  constraints.  This also can be
     useful to quickly exit asa ()  if  this  is  requested  by  your  cost
     function:   Setting  the  value of Limit_Invalid_Generated_States to 0
     will exit at the next calculation of the cost function (possibly after
     a  few  more exiting calls to calculate tangents and curvatures).  For
     example, to exit asa () at a specific number of generated points,  set
     up  a  counter  in your cost function, e.g., similar to the one in the
     test function in asa_usr.c.  For all calls >= the limit of the  number
     of    calls    to    the   cost   function,   terminate   by   setting
     OPTIONS->Limit_Invalid_Generated_States = 0 and setting  *cost_flag  =
     FALSE.    (Note   that  a  quick  exit  also  can  be  achieved  using
     OPTIONS->Immediate_Exit.)

     9.3.4.  OPTIONS->Accepted_To_Generated_Ratio[1.0E-6]

          The  least  ratio of accepted to generated states.  If this value
     is encountered, then the usual tests, including possible  reannealing,
     are   initiated   even   if   the   timing   does  not  coincide  with
     Acceptance_Frequency_Modulus or  Generated_Frequency_Modulus  (defined
     below).    All   the   templates   in   ASA   have  been  set  to  use
     Accepted_To_Generated_Ratio=1.0E-4 to illustrate the way these options
     can be changed.

     9.3.5.  OPTIONS->Cost_Precision[1.0E-18]

          This  sets the precision required of the cost function if exiting
     because of reaching Maximum_Cost_Repeat, which is effective as long as
     Maximum_Cost_Repeat > 0.

     9.3.6.  OPTIONS->Maximum_Cost_Repeat[5]

          The  maximum  number  of  times  that  the  cost function repeats
     itself, within limits set by Cost_Precision,  before  quitting.   This
     test   is   performed   only   when   Acceptance_Frequency_Modulus  or
     Generated_Frequency_Modulus is invoked, or when the ratio of  accepted
     to generated points is less than Accepted_To_Generated_Ratio, in order
     to  help  prevent  exiting  prematurely  in  a  local   minimum.    If

     Maximum_Cost_Repeat is 0, this test is bypassed.

     9.3.7.  OPTIONS->Number_Cost_Samples[5]

          When  Number_Cost_Samples  >  0,  the initial cost temperature is
     calculated   as   the   average   of   the    absolute    values    of
     Number_Cost_Samples sampled cost functions.

          When  Number_Cost_Samples  <  -1, the initial cost temperature is
     calculated as the deviation  over  a  sample  of  -Number_Cost_Samples
     number  of  cost functions, i.e., the square-root of the difference of
     the second moment and the square of the first  moment,  normalized  by
     the ratio of -Number_Cost_Samples to -Number_Cost_Samples - 1.

          When  ASA_SAVE  is  set  to TRUE, Number_Cost_Samples is set to 1
     after  the  initial  run  since  all  the  required  information   for
     subsequent runs already has been collected.

          If  the  calculated  initial  cost  temperature  is not set using
     USER_INITIAL_COST_TEMP, and if it is essentially zero  (using  a  test
     with  SMALL_FLOAT),  then  it  is reset to e = 2.718.  If ASA_PRINT is
     TRUE a warning is printed.

          See Reanneal_Cost for similar treatment of  the  reannealed  cost
     temperature.

     9.3.8.  OPTIONS->Temperature_Ratio_Scale[1.0E-5]

          This scale is  a  guide  to  the  expected  cost  temperature  of
     convergence  within a small range of the global minimum.  As explained
     in the ASA papers, and as outlined in the ASA-NOTES, this is  used  to
     set  the  rates of annealing.  Here is a brief description in terms of
     the temperature schedule outlined above.

          As  a  useful  physical  guide,  the   temperature   is   further
     parameterized  in  terms  of  quantities  m_i and n_i, derived from an
     "expected" final temperature (which is not enforced in ASA), T_fi,
             T_fi = T_0i exp(-m_i) when k_fi = exp(n_i),
             c_i = m_i exp(-n_i/D).
     However, note that  since  the  initial  temperatures  and  generating
     indices, T_0i and k_i, are independently scaled for each parameter, it
     usually is reasonable to simply take {c_i, m_i, n_i} to be independent
     of the index i, i.e., to be {c, m, n} for all i.

          In asa.c,
             m = -log(Temperature_Ratio_Scale).
     This  can be overridden if RATIO_TEMPERATURE_SCALES (further discussed
     below)  is  set  to  TRUE,  and  then   values   of   multipliers   of
     -log(Temperature_Ratio_Scale)  are  used  in asa.c.  These multipliers
     are calculated in the user module  as  OPTIONS->User_Temperature_Ratio
     [].  Then,
             m_i = m OPTIONS->User_Temperature_Ratio[i].

          For  large  numbers  of  parameters, Temperature_Ratio_Scale is a
     very influential Program Option in determining the scale of  parameter
     annealing.   It likely would be best to start with a larger value than
     the default, to slow down the annealing.

          The ASA-NOTES contain a section giving a little more  explanation
     on the use of Temperature_Ratio_Scale.

     9.3.9.  OPTIONS->Cost_Parameter_Scale_Ratio[1.0]

          This is the ratio of cost:parameter temperature annealing scales.
     As explained in the ASA papers, and as outlined in the ASA-NOTES, this
     is used to set the rates of annealing.

          In terms  of  the  algebraic  development  given  above  for  the
     Temperature_Ratio_Scale, in asa.c,
             c_cost = c Cost_Parameter_Scale_Ratio.

          Cost_Parameter_Scale_Ratio  is  a very influential Program Option
     in determining the scale of annealing of the cost function.

     9.3.10.  OPTIONS->Temperature_Anneal_Scale[100.0]

          This  scale  is  a guide to achieve the expected cost temperature
     sought  by  Temperature_Ratio_Scale  within  the  limits  expected  by
     Limit_Acceptances.  As explained in the ASA papers, and as outlined in
     the ASA-NOTES, this is used to set the rates of annealing.

          In terms  of  the  algebraic  development  given  above  for  the
     Temperature_Ratio_Scale, in asa.c,
             n = log(Temperature_Anneal_Scale).

          For   large   numbers   of  parameters,  Temperature_Anneal_Scale
     probably should at least initially  be  set  to  values  greater  than
     *number_parameters,   although  it  will  not  be  as  influential  as
     Temperature_Ratio_Scale.

     9.3.11.  OPTIONS->User_Cost_Temperature

          If     USER_INITIAL_COST_TEMP     is     TRUE,     a     pointer,
     OPTIONS->User_Cost_Temperature,  is  used to adaptively initialize the
     cost   temperature.     If    this    choice    is    elected,    then
     User_Cost_Temperature [] must be initialized.

     9.3.12.  OPTIONS->Include_Integer_Parameters[FALSE]

          If Include_Integer_Parameters is TRUE, include integer parameters
     in   derivative   and  reannealing  calculations,  except  those  with
     INTEGER_TYPE  (2).   This  is  useful  when  the  parameters  can   be
     analytically continued between their integer values, or if you set the
     parameter increments to integral values by setting  ASA_RESOLUTION  to
     TRUE, as discussed further below.

     9.3.13.  OPTIONS->User_Initial_Parameters[FALSE]

          ASA  always  requests  that  the  user  guess  initial  values of
     starting parameters, since that guess is as good as any  random  guess
     the code might make.  The default is to use the ASA distribution about
     this point to generate an initial state of parameters and value of the
     cost    function    that   satisfy   the   user's   constraints.    If
     User_Initial_Parameters is set to TRUE, then the first user's guess is
     used to calculate this first state.

     9.3.14.  OPTIONS->Sequential_Parameters[-1]

          The  ASA  default for generating new points in parameter space is
     to find a new point in the full space, rather than to sample the space
     one  parameter  at  a  time  as  do most other algorithms.  This is in
     accord with the general philosophy of sampling the space  without  any
     prior  knowledge  of ordering of the parameters.  However, if you have
     reason to believe that at some stage(s) of search there might be  some
     benefit   to   sampling   the   parameters   sequentially,   then  set
     Sequential_Parameters to the parameter number you wish to  start  your
     annealing  cycle,  i.e., ranging from 0 to (*parameter_dimension - 1).
     Then, ASA will cycle through your parameters in  the  order  you  have
     placed  them in all arrays defining their properties, keeping track of
     which     parameter     is     actively     being     modified      in
     OPTIONS->Sequential_Parameters,  thereby  permitting adaptive changes.
     Any negative value for Sequential_Parameters will use the default  ASA
     algorithm.   Upon  exiting asa (), Sequential_Parameters is reset back
     to its initial value.

     9.3.15.  OPTIONS->Initial_Parameter_Temperature[1.0]

          The  initial  temperature for all parameters.  This is overridden
     by use of the USER_INITIAL_PARAMETERS_TEMPS option.

     9.3.16.  OPTIONS->User_Temperature_Ratio

          If    RATIO_TEMPERATURE_SCALES    is     TRUE,     a     pointer,
     OPTIONS->User_Temperature_Ratio,  is  used to adaptively set ratios of
     scales used to anneal the parameters in the cost function.   This  can
     be  useful  when  some  parameters  are  not being reannealed, or when
     setting the initial temperatures (using  USER_INITIAL_PARAMETERS_TEMPS
     set to TRUE) is not sufficient to handle all your parameters properly.
     This typically is not encountered, so it is advised to look  elsewhere
     at  first  to  improve  your  search.  If this choice is elected, then
     User_Temperature_Ratio [] must be initialized.

     9.3.17.  OPTIONS->User_Parameter_Temperature

          If   USER_INITIAL_PARAMETERS_TEMPS   is    TRUE,    a    pointer,
     OPTIONS->User_Parameter_Temperature,  is used to adaptively initialize
     parameters  temperatures.    If   this   choice   is   elected,   then
     User_Parameter_Temperature [] must be initialized.

     9.3.18.  OPTIONS->Acceptance_Frequency_Modulus[100]

          The frequency of testing for periodic  testing  and  reannealing,
     dependent     on     the    number    of    accepted    states.     If
     Acceptance_Frequency_Modulus is set  to  0,  then  this  test  is  not
     performed.

     9.3.19.  OPTIONS->Generated_Frequency_Modulus[10000]

          The frequency of testing for periodic  testing  and  reannealing,
     dependent     on    the    number    of    generated    states.     If
     Generated_Frequency_Modulus is  set  to  0,  then  this  test  is  not
     performed.

     9.3.20.  OPTIONS->Reanneal_Cost[1]

          A  value  of Reanneal_Cost set to FALSE=0 bypasses reannealing of
     the cost temperature.  This might  be  done  for  systems  where  such
     reannealing  is  not  useful.  Note that the use of USER_REANNEAL_COST
     permits  users  to  define  their  own  cost  temperature  reannealing
     algorithm when Reanneal_Cost is not 0 or -1.

          A  value  of Reanneal_Cost = 1 permits the default reannealing of
     the cost temperature to be part of the  fitting  process,  correlating
     the cost temperature with the current last and best values of the cost
     function as described above.

          If  Reanneal_Cost  >  1,  then  the   reannealed   initial   cost
     temperature   is   calculated  as  the  deviation  over  a  sample  of
     -Reanneal_Cost number of cost functions, i.e., the square-root of  the
     difference  of  the  second moment and the square of the first moment,
     normalized by the ratio of Reanneal_Cost to Reanneal_Cost  -  1.   For
     example,  if  the  initial  cost temperature is reannealed to a larger
     value,  this  increases  the  effective  index  of  the  current  cost
     temperature,  effectively  slowing down the rate of decrease of future
     current  cost  temperatures  as  this  index  is  increased  for  each
     acceptance test.

          If Reanneal_Cost < -1, then the cost index is reset to 1, and the
     initial and current cost temperatures are calculated as the  deviation
     over  a  sample  of -Reanneal_Cost number of cost functions, i.e., the
     square-root of the difference of the second moment and the  square  of
     the  first  moment,  normalized  by  the  ratio  of  -Reanneal_Cost to
     -Reanneal_Cost - 1.  This often gives rise to fluctuating current cost
     temperatures,  sometimes diminishing the value of the acceptance test.
     However, for some systems that have different  behavior  at  different
     scales, this can be a very useful OPTIONS.

          The  algorithms  with Reanneal_Cost > 1 or < -1 typically require
     more calls to the cost function than the default of Reanneal_Cost = 1.
     This  typically  is  even  more  so  when Reanneal_Cost < -1 than when
     Reanneal_Cost > 1 due to the resetting of the current cost temperature
     as  well  as the initial cost temperature.  Because of the fat tail of
     the parameter distributions, quite often relatively  large  values  of

     the cost function will be included in the periodic sampling.  However,
     of course the parameter temperatures continue  to  diminish,  focusing
     the fit towards the global optimal value.

          Note   that   Number_Cost_Samples   can  be  used  similarly  for
     calculating the initial cost temperature.

     9.3.21.  OPTIONS->Reanneal_Parameters[TRUE]

          This permits reannealing of the parameter temperatures to be part
     of  the  fitting  process.   This  might  have  to be set to FALSE for
     systems with very large numbers of parameters  just  to  decrease  the
     number of function calls.

     9.3.22.  OPTIONS->Delta_X[0.001]

          The  fractional  increment  of  parameters used to take numerical
     derivatives  when  calculating  tangents  for  reannealing,  for  each
     parameter   chosen   to   be  reannealed.   This  is  overridden  when
     DELTA_PARAMETERS is set to TRUE.  If Delta_X is  set  to  0,  then  no
     tangents are calculated.

          Note,   that   for   second-derivative   off-diagonal   curvature
     calculations, the algorithm used may cause evaluations  of  your  cost
     function  outside  a  range  when  a parameter being sampled is at the
     boundary.  However, only values of parameters within the ranges set by
     the  user  are actually used for acceptance tests.  Note that the user
     may set User_Tangents to TRUE, as discussed below, to choose any other
     algorithm  to calculate derivatives or other indicators to be used for
     reannealing.

          When calculating derivatives, an  invalid  cost  function,  i.e.,
     returning  *cost_flag  = FALSE from the cost function, will exit asa()
     with *exit_code INVALID_COST_FUNCTION_DERIV.  Also,  when  calculating
     derivatives,  no  extra test is performed to check that parameters are
     within their lower and upper bounds (since meshes for derivatives  may
     exceed  these  bounds).   If this is not desired, then within the cost
     function, within a test for USER_OPTIONS->Locate_Cost == 3, a decision
     may be made whether to return this *exit_code.

     9.3.23.  OPTIONS->User_Delta_Parameter

          If       DELTA_PARAMETERS      is      TRUE,      a      pointer,
     OPTIONS->User_Delta_Parameter, is used to adaptively set increments of
     parameters  used  to  take pseudo-derivatives (numerical derivatives),
     for each parameter chosen to be reannealed.  For example, this can  be
     useful  to reanneal integer parameters when a choice is made to permit
     their derivatives to be  taken.   If  this  choice  is  elected,  then
     OPTIONS->User_Delta_Parameter [] must be initialized.  No tangents are
     calculated for any parameter if User_Delta_Parameter[] is 0.

     9.3.24.  OPTIONS->User_Tangents[FALSE]

          By  default,  asa ()   calculates   numerical   tangents   (first
     derivatives)  of  the  cost  function  for  use  in reannealing and to
     provide this information to the user.  However,  if  User_Tangents  is
     set  to  TRUE,  then when asa () requires tangents to be calculated, a
     value of *valid_state_generated_flag (called *cost_flag in ASA_TEST in
     asa_usr.c  and  asa_usr_cst.c)  of  -1 is set and the cost function is
     called.  The user is expected to set up a test in the beginning of the
     cost  function to sense this value, and then calculate the tangents []
     array (containing the derivatives of the cost  function,  or  whatever
     sensitivity  measure  is  desired  to  be  used for reannealing) to be
     returned   to   asa ().    An   example    is    provided    with    a
     ASA_TEMPLATE_SAMPLE.

     9.3.25.  OPTIONS->Curvature_0[FALSE]

          If  the  curvature  array is quite large for your system, and you
     really do not use this information, you can set  Curvature_0  to  TRUE
     which  just  requires a one-dimensional curvature [0] to be defined to
     pass to the asa module (to avoid problems with some systems).  This is
     most  useful, and typically is necessary, when minimizing systems with
     large numbers of parameters since  the  curvature  array  is  of  size
     number of parameters squared.

          If  you wish to calculate the curvature array periodically, every
     reannealing   cycle   determined   by    Acceptance_Frequency_Modulus,
     Generated_Frequency_Modulus,  or Accepted_To_Generated_Ratio, then set
     OPTIONS->Curvature_0 to -1.

          If      QUENCH_PARAMETERS      is      TRUE,      a      pointer,
     OPTIONS->User_Quench_Param_Scale,  is used to adaptively set the scale
     of  the  temperature  schedule.   If  this  choice  is  elected,  then
     OPTIONS->User_Quench_Param_Scale  []  must  be initialized, and values
     defined for each dimension.  The default  in  the  asa  module  is  to
     assign  the annealing value of 1 to all elements that might be defined
     otherwise.  If values are selected greater than 1 using  this  Program
     Option, then quenching is enforced.

          Note  that  you  can  use this control quite differently, to slow
     down the annealing process by setting OPTIONS->User_Quench_Param_Scale
     []  to  values  less than 1.  This can be useful in problems where the
     global optimal point is at a quite different scale  from  other  local
     optima, masking its presence.

          If  OPTIONS_FILE_DATA,  QUENCH_COST,  and  QUENCH_PARAMETERS  are
     TRUE, then *User_Quench_Cost_Scale and User_Quench_Param_Scale []  all
     are  read  in  from asa_opt.  If RECUR_OPTIONS_FILE_DATA, QUENCH_COST,
     and  QUENCH_PARAMETERS  are  TRUE,  then  *User_Quench_Cost_Scale  and
     User_Quench_Param_Scale [] all are read in from asa_opt_recur.

     9.3.27.  OPTIONS->User_Quench_Cost_Scale

          If        QUENCH_COST       is       TRUE,       a       pointer,
     OPTIONS->User_Quench_Cost_Scale, is used to adaptively set  the  scale
     of  the  temperature  schedule.   If  this  choice  is  elected,  then
     OPTIONS->User_Quench_Cost_Scale [0] must be initialized.  The  default
     in  the  asa  module  is  to  assign  the annealing value of 1 to this
     element that might be defined otherwise.

          OPTIONS->User_Quench_Cost_Scale may be changed adaptively without
     affecting  the  ergodicity  of the algorithm, within reason of course.
     This  might  be  useful  for  some  systems  that  require   different
     approaches to the cost function in different ranges of its parameters.
     Note that increasing this parameter beyond  its  default  of  1.0  can
     result  in rapidly locking in the search to a small region of the cost
     function, severely handicapping the algorithm.  On the  contrary,  you
     may  find  that slowing the cost temperature schedule, by setting this
     parameter to a value less than 1.0, may work better for your system.

          If   OPTIONS_FILE_DATA   and   QUENCH_COST   are    TRUE,    then
     *User_Quench_Cost_Scale    is    read    in    from    asa_opt.     If
     RECUR_OPTIONS_FILE_DATA    and    QUENCH_COST    are    TRUE,     then
     *User_Quench_Cost_Scale is read in from asa_opt_recur.

     9.3.28.  OPTIONS->N_Accepted

          N_Accepted  contains  the  current  number of points saved by the
     acceptance criteria.  This can be used to monitor the fit.  On exiting
     from      asa ()      N_Accepted     contains     the     value     of
     *best_number_accepted_saved  in  asa.c.   Note  that  the   value   of
     N_Accepted  typically  will  be  less  in  the  cost  function than in
     ASA_OUT, as the value of the returned cost  must  be  tested  back  in
     asa () to see if N_Accepted should be incremented.

     9.3.29.  OPTIONS->N_Generated

          N_Generated  contains  the  current  number  of generated states.
     This can  be  used  to  monitor  the  fit.   On  exiting  from  asa ()
     N_Generated  contains  the  value  of  *best_number_generated_saved in
     asa.c.  Note that the value of N_Generated typically will be  less  in
     the  cost  function than in ASA_OUT, as this value is only incremented
     upon returning to asa() if some tests are passed.

          If    ASA_PARALLEL    is    TRUE,    then     N_Generated     and
     *best_number_generated_saved will only be accurate within the scale of
     OPTIONS->Gener_Block, as these are updated in the acceptance function.

     9.3.30.  OPTIONS->Locate_Cost

          Locate_Cost is a flag set in asa (), telling at  what  point  the
     cost  function  is  being  called.  This can be useful for determining
     when to perform tests while in your cost function.  When ASA_PRINT  is
     TRUE,  the  value is printed out upon exiting asa ().  Note that there
     are several possible values that  be  reasonable,  depending  on  from

          Locate_Cost  =  0.   The cost function is being used for the
          initial cost temperature.

          Locate_Cost = 1.  The cost function is being  used  for  the
          initial cost value.

          Locate_Cost  = 2.  The cost function is being used for a new
          generated state.

          Locate_Cost = 12.  The cost function is being used for a new
          generated state just after a new best state was achieved.

          Locate_Cost  =  3.   The cost function is being used for the
          cost derivatives to reanneal the parameters.

          Locate_Cost = 4.   The  cost  function  is  being  used  for
          reannealing the cost temperature.

          Locate_Cost  =  5.   The cost function is being used for the
          exiting of asa () to calculate final curvatures.

          Acceptance_Frequency_Modulus,   Generated_Frequency_Modulus,
          or Accepted_To_Generated_Ratio.

          When  calculating  derivatives,  an  invalid cost function, i.e.,
     returning *cost_flag = FALSE from the cost function, will  exit  asa()
     with  *exit_code  INVALID_COST_FUNCTION_DERIV.  Also, when calculating
     derivatives, no extra test is performed to check that  parameters  are
     within  their lower and upper bounds (since meshes for derivatives may
     exceed these bounds).  If this is not desired, then  within  the  cost
     function, within a test for USER_OPTIONS->Locate_Cost == 3, a decision
     may be made whether to return this *exit_code.

     9.3.31.  OPTIONS->Immediate_Exit[FALSE]

          OPTIONS->Immediate_Exit is initialized  to  FALSE  when  entering
     asa ().   At  any  time  during  the  fit,  except  while  the call to
     cost_function ()  from  asa ()  is  being  used  simply  to  calculate
     derivatives  or  the cost temperature, if the user sets Immediate_Exit
     to TRUE, then just after bookkeeping is performed  by  the  acceptance
     test,   asa ()  will  exit  with  code  IMMEDIATE_EXIT.   All  closing
     calculations of current cost_tangents []  and  cost_curvature  []  are
     bypassed.

     9.3.32.  OPTIONS->Best_Cost

          In  asa_usr_asa.h,  the  OPTIONS  *Best_Cost  is a pointer to the
     value of the cost function of  the  saved  best  state  calculated  in
     asa ().   E.g.,  together with *Best_Parameters and Locate_Cost, these
     OPTIONS can aid several adaptive features of ASA, e.g., automating the

          In asa_usr_asa.h, the OPTIONS *Best_Parameters is  a  pointer  to
     the  values  of  the  parameters of the saved best state calculated in
     asa ().  E.g., together with *Best_Cost and Locate_Cost, these OPTIONS
     can  aid  several  adaptive  features  of  ASA,  e.g.,  automating the

     sampling.

     9.3.34.  OPTIONS->Last_Cost

          In  asa_usr_asa.h,  the  OPTIONS  *Last_Cost  is a pointer to the
     value of the cost function of  the  last  saved  state  calculated  in
     asa ().    This  can  be  compared  to  *Best_Cost  as  a  measure  of
     fluctuations among local minima.  An example of use in a  user-defined
     acceptance  test  is  in  asa_usr.c when USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST is TRUE.
     This OPTIONS is  to  be  used  read-only  by  the  cost  function,  as
     calculated  in  asa (); do not change it in the user module unless you
     so wish to modify the sampling.

     9.3.35.  OPTIONS->Last_Parameters

          In asa_usr_asa.h, the OPTIONS *Last_Parameters is  a  pointer  to
     the  values  of  the  parameters of the last saved state calculated in
     asa ().  This can be compared to  *Best_Parameters  as  a  measure  of
     fluctuations among local minima.  This OPTIONS is to be used read-only
     by the cost function, as calculated in asa (); do not change it in the
     user module unless you so wish to modify the sampling.

     9.3.36.  OPTIONS->Asa_Data_Dim_Dbl

          If  the  Pre-Compile  Option  OPTIONAL_DATA_DBL [FALSE] is set to
     TRUE, an additional Program Option, OPTIONS->Asa_Data_Dim_Dbl, becomes
     available to define the dimension of OPTIONS->Asa_Data_Dbl [].

     9.3.37.  OPTIONS->Asa_Data_Dbl

          If  the  Pre-Compile  Option  OPTIONAL_DATA_DBL [FALSE] is set to
     TRUE, an additional  Program  Option  pointer,  OPTIONS->Asa_Data_Dbl,
     becomes  available to return additional information to the user module
     from the asa module.   This  information  communicates  with  the  asa
     module,  and  memory  must be allocated for it in the user module.  An
     example is given in asa_usr.c when SELF_OPTIMIZE is TRUE.

          If the Pre-Compile Option OPTIONAL_DATA_INT  [FALSE]  is  set  to
     TRUE, an additional Program Option, OPTIONS->Asa_Data_Dim_Int, becomes
     available to define the dimension of OPTIONS->Asa_Data_Int [].

     9.3.39.  OPTIONS->Asa_Data_Int

          If the Pre-Compile Option OPTIONAL_DATA_INT  [FALSE]  is  set  to
     TRUE,  an  additional  Program  Option pointer, OPTIONS->Asa_Data_Int,
     becomes available to return additional integer information to the user
     module  from  the  asa module.  This information communicates with the
     asa module, and memory must be allocated for it in the user module.

     9.3.40.  OPTIONS->Asa_Data_Dim_Ptr

          If the Pre-Compile Option OPTIONAL_DATA_PTR  [FALSE]  is  set  to
     TRUE, an additional Program Option, OPTIONS->Asa_Data_Dim_Ptr, becomes
     available to define the dimension of OPTIONS->Asa_Data_Ptr.

          For example, a value of Asa_Data_Dim_Ptr = 2 might be used to set
     different  entries in data arrays at two levels of recursion.  See the
     discussion  under  OPTIONAL_DATA_PTR  and  Asa_Data_Ptr  for  use   in
     multiple recursion.

     9.3.41.  OPTIONS->Asa_Data_Ptr

          If  the  Pre-Compile  Option  OPTIONAL_DATA_PTR [FALSE] is set to
     TRUE, an additional  Program  Option  pointer,  OPTIONS->Asa_Data_Ptr,
     becomes  available  to  define  an  array,  of  type OPTIONAL_PTR_TYPE
     defined by the user, which can be used to  pass  arbitrary  arrays  or
     structures  to  the user module from the asa module.  This information
     communicates with the asa module, and memory must be allocated for  it
     in the user module.

          For  example,  struct  DATA might contain an array data[10] to be
     used in the cost_function.  Asa_Data_Dim_Ptr might  have  a  value  2.
     Set   #define   OPTIONAL_PTR_TYPE   DATA.   Then,  data[3]  in  struct
     Asa_Data_Ptr[1]     could     be     set     and      accessed      as
     USER_OPTIONS->Asa_Data_Ptr[1].data[3] in the cost function.

          For  example,  your main program that calls asa_main() would have
     developed a struct SelectedType *SelectedPointer,  and  you  can  call
     asa_main(SelectedPointer, ...).  In asa_usr_asa.h, you would have
          #define OPTIONAL_PTR_TYPE SelectedType
     In    asa_usr.c    (and    asa_usr.h)    you    would    develop   int
     asa_main(OPTIONAL_PTR_TYPE *OptionalPointer, ...) and,  close  to  the
     appropriate ASA_TEMPLATE, you would set
          USER_OPTIONS->Asa_Data_Ptr = OptionalPointer;
     if  Asa_Data_Dim_Ptr  =  1  were  being  passed  to ASA; otherwise, if
     Asa_Data_Dim_Ptr > 1, as illustrated in the ASA_TEMPLATE in asa_usr.c,
     memory  must  be allocated (and then freed) for Asa_Data_Ptr, and each
     dimension must be properly aligned with the structs being passed  from
     the main program.

          Note  that the typedef of the SelectedType struct (whether or not
     you explicitly use the term typedef), developed in your main  program,
     cannot be passed by its name to asa_main(), and so it must be declared
     as well in the asa module.  In asa_usr_asa.h, the SelectedType  struct
     can be included with the use of an #include SelectedStruct.h common to
     your main program and asa_usr_asa.h.

          As noted in asa_usr.c,  before  exiting  asa_main(),  instead  of
     freeing  Asa_Data_Ptr, if memory has been allocated outside ASA, e.g.,
     by the use of ASA_LIB, use
          USER_OPTIONS->Asa_Data_Ptr = NULL;

          The  http://www.ingber.com/asa_examples.txt  file  contains  some
     guidance of the use of OPTIONAL_DATA_PTR and Asa_Data_Ptr.

     9.3.42.  OPTIONS->Asa_Out_File

          If you wish to have the printing from the asa module be sent to a
     file determined dynamically from the user module, set the  Pre-Compile
     Printing  Option  USER_ASA_OUT [FALSE] to TRUE, and define the Program
     Option *Asa_Out_File in the user module.  (This overrides any  ASA_OUT
     settings.)   An  example of this use for multiple asa () runs is given
     in the user module.

     9.3.43.  OPTIONS->Asa_Usr_Out_File

          If you wish to have the printing from the user module be sent  to
     a   file   determined  dynamically  from  the  user  module,  set  the
     Pre-Compile Printing Option  USER_ASA_USR_OUT  [FALSE]  to  TRUE,  and
     define the Program Option *Asa_Usr_Out_File in the user module.  (This
     overrides any USER_OUT settings.)

     9.3.44.  OPTIONS->Cost_Schedule

          If   USER_COST_SCHEDULE   [FALSE]   is   set   to   TRUE,    then
     (*Cost_Schedule)   ()   is  created  as  a  pointer  to  the  function
     user_cost_schedule () in asa_usr.c, and to recur_user_cost_schedule ()
     if SELF_OPTIMIZE is set to TRUE.

     9.3.45.  OPTIONS->Asymp_Exp_Param

          When USER_ACCEPT_ASYMP_EXP [FALSE] is TRUE, an asymptotic form of
     the exponential function as an alternative to the  Boltzmann  function
     becomes    available   for   the   acceptance   test.    A   parameter
     OPTIONS->Asymp_Exp_Param becomes available, with a default of  1.0  in
     asa_usr.c  giving  the  standard  Boltzmann  function.  The asymptotic
     approximation to the exp function used for the acceptance distribution
     is
             exp(-x) -> [1-(1-q)x]^[1/(1-q)].
     If  you  require  a  more  moderate  acceptance  test,  then  negative
     Asymp_Exp_Param may be helpful.

          If  USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST  [FALSE]  is  set  to   TRUE,   then   (
     *Acceptance_Test  )  ()  is  created  as  a  pointer  to  the function
     user_acceptance_test      ()      in      asa_usr.c,      and       to
     recur_user_acceptance_test () if SELF_OPTIMIZE is set to TRUE.

     9.3.47.  OPTIONS->User_Acceptance_Flag

          If   USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST   [FALSE]   is   set   to   TRUE,  then
     User_Acceptance_Flag is created.  In asa (),  User_Acceptance_Flag  is
     set  to  TRUE  prior  to calling the cost function whenever acceptance
     tests need not be performed, i.e., when using  the  cost  function  to
     generate initial conditions, when being used to calculate derivatives,
     or when samples are being generated to calculate the cost temperature;
     otherwise  it  is  set  to FALSE.  If User_Acceptance_Flag is returned
     from the cost function as FALSE, then it  is  assumed  that  the  cost
     function  will  fail  the acceptance criteria, but other data is still
     collected in the acceptance function.  When  entering  the  acceptance
     test  in asa, a test is done to see if the acceptance test has already
     been   determined   by   the   cost    function;    if    not,    then
     OPTIONS->Acceptance_Test () is called to calculate the acceptance test
     to determine the resulting value of User_Acceptance_Flag.

     9.3.48.  OPTIONS->Cost_Acceptance_Flag

          If  USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST   [FALSE]   is   set   to   TRUE,   then
     Cost_Acceptance_Flag  is  created.  In asa (), Cost_Acceptance_Flag is
     set to a default of FALSE before entering the cost function.  If  both
     Cost_Acceptance_Flag  and  User_Acceptance_Flag  are returned from the
     cost function as TRUE, then it is assumed that the cost  function  has
     decided  that  the  acceptance  criteria  is passed, and other data is
     collected in the acceptance function.

     9.3.49.  OPTIONS->Cost_Temp_Curr

          If  USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST   [FALSE]   is   set   to   TRUE,   then
     Cost_Temp_Curr   is   available   to   user_cost_function   and/or  to
     OPTIONS->Acceptance_Test to calculate the acceptance criteria.

     9.3.50.  OPTIONS->Cost_Temp_Init

          If  USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST   [FALSE]   is   set   to   TRUE,   then
     Cost_Temp_Init   is   available   to   user_cost_function   and/or  to
     OPTIONS->Acceptance_Test to calculate the acceptance criteria.

     9.3.51.  OPTIONS->Cost_Temp_Scale

          If  USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST   [FALSE]   is   set   to   TRUE,   then
     Cost_Temp_Scale   is   available   to   user_cost_function  and/or  to
     OPTIONS->Acceptance_Test to calculate the acceptance criteria.

          If USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST [FALSE] is set to TRUE, then Prob_Bias is
     returned  by  the  user module to the asa module.  This usually is the
     Boltzmann test term which is compared with a uniform random number  to

     such as ASA_SAMPLE.

     user_generating_distrib     ()     in      asa_usr.c,      and      to
     recur_user_generating_distrib () if SELF_OPTIMIZE is set to TRUE.  The
     parameters passed to these functions are further described below.

     9.3.55.  OPTIONS->Reanneal_Cost_Function

          If   USER_REANNEAL_COST   [FALSE]   is   set   to   TRUE,    then
     (*Reanneal_Cost_Function)  ()  is created as a pointer to the function
     user_reanneal_cost () in asa_usr.c, and to recur_user_reanneal_cost ()
     if SELF_OPTIMIZE is set to TRUE.

     9.3.56.  OPTIONS->Reanneal_Params_Function

          If   USER_REANNEAL_PARAMETERS   [FALSE]  is  set  to  TRUE,  then
     (*Reanneal_Params_Function) () is created as a pointer to the function
     user_reanneal_params       ()      in      asa_usr.c,      and      to
     recur_user_reanneal_params () if SELF_OPTIMIZE is set to TRUE.

     9.3.57.  OPTIONS->Bias_Acceptance

          If ASA_SAMPLE is TRUE, this is the bias of the current state from
     the Boltzmann acceptance test described above, taken to be the minimum
     of one and the Boltzmann factor if the new point is accepted, and  one
     minus this number if it is rejected.

     9.3.58.  OPTIONS->Bias_Generated

          If   ASA_SAMPLE  is  TRUE,  a  pointer,  OPTIONS->Bias_Generated,
     contains the the biases of  the  current  state  from  the  generating
     distributions  of  all active parameters, described above.  Memory for
     OPTIONS->Bias_Generated [] must be created in the user module.

     9.3.59.  OPTIONS->Average_Weights

          IF ASA_SAMPLE is TRUE, this is the average of  the  weight  array
     holding  the  products  of the inverse asa generating distributions of
     all active parameters.

          For example, OPTIONS->N_Accepted can be used to  monitor  changes
     in   a   new   saved   point   in   the   cost   function,   and  when
     OPTIONS->Average_Weights reaches a specified number (perhaps  repeated
     several  times),  the  cost function could return an invalid flag from
     the cost function to terminate the run.  When the  Average_Weights  is
     very   small,   then   additional   sampled  points  likely  will  not
     substantially contribute more information.

     9.3.60.  OPTIONS->Limit_Weights

          If ASA_SAMPLE is set to TRUE, Limit_Weights is  a  limit  on  the
     value  of  the  average  of  the  weight array holding the inverse asa
     generating distribution.  When this lower limit is crossed,  asa  will
     no  longer  send  sampling output to be printed out, although it still
     will be calculated.  As the run progresses, this average will decrease
     until   contributions   from   further   sampling   become  relatively
     unimportant.

     9.3.61.  OPTIONS->Queue_Size

          If ASA_QUEUE is set to TRUE, Queue_Size is a limit on the size of
     the  FIFO  queue  used  to store generated states.  This array must be
     defined in the user module.

          After Queue_Size has been set, and memory created in asa  (),  it
     may be changed adaptively to any number less than this.  If Queue_Size
     is 0, then no queue is used.

     9.3.62.  OPTIONS->Queue_Resolution

          If ASA_QUEUE is set to TRUE, Queue_Resolution is a pointer to  an
     array   of   resolutions  used  to  compare  the  currently  generated
     parameters to  those  in  the  queue.   This  array  must  have  space
     allocated  and  be defined in the user module.  See the discussions on
     ASA_QUEUE and ASA_RESOLUTION on the differences in operations of these
     two OPTIONS.

          The  ASA_QUEUE OPTIONS also can be used to coarse-grain a fit, by
     setting high values of Queue_Resolution [].

     9.3.63.  OPTIONS->Coarse_Resolution

          If ASA_RESOLUTION is set to TRUE, Coarse_Resolution is a  pointer
     to  an  array  of  resolutions used to resolve the values of generated
     parameters.  This array must have space allocated and  be  defined  in
     the  user module.  See the discussions on ASA_QUEUE and ASA_RESOLUTION
     on the differences in operations of these two OPTIONS.

     9.3.64.  OPTIONS->Fit_Local

          If FITLOC is TRUE, OPTIONS->Fit_Local is passed to  cost_function
     ().   This  provides  additional flexibility in deciding when to shunt
     asa  ()  over  to  fitloc  (),  e.g.,  during  multiple  or  recursive
     optimizations.  As used in asa_usr.c, a value of Fit_Local set >= 1 is
     required to enter the local code.

          If Fit_Local is set to 2, any better fit found by the local  code
     better  than  asa ()  is  ignored  if  that  local  fit is achieved by
     violating the ranges of the parameters.  This additional test is  much
     stricter than that imposed by OPTIONS->Penalty,

     9.3.65.  OPTIONS->Iter_Max

          When  FITLOC  is  TRUE,  OPTIONS->Iter_Max determines the maximum
     iterations of the cost_function () by simplex ().

     9.3.66.  OPTIONS->Penalty

          If FITLOC is TRUE,  OPTIONS->Penalty  determines  how  to  weight
     violation of constraints, exceeding boundaries, etc.

     9.3.67.  Multi_Number

          If  MULTI_MIN  is  set  to  TRUE, then OPTIONS->Multi_Number, the
     number of best-generated states of the lowest sampled  values  of  the
     cost function, must be set by the user.  Of course this can be changed
     adaptively.

          Note  that  OPTIONS->Multi_Cost  and  OPTIONS->Multi_Params   are
     seeded  with  the highest cost function state just before entering the
     main annealing loop.  Therefore, if  OPTIONS->Multi_Number  is  larger
     than the actual number of accepted best states (new lowest values), or
     if a set of states are identical within the precision  reported,  then
     there  will  be  a  set  of  duplicate states returned which should be
     filtered via a unique macro.

     9.3.68.  OPTIONS->Multi_Cost

          If  MULTI_MIN  is  TRUE,  OPTIONS->Multi_Cost  save  the   lowest
     OPTIONS->Multi_Number values of the cost function.

     9.3.69.  OPTIONS->Multi_Params

          If  MULTI_MIN  is TRUE, OPTIONS->Multi_Params save the parameters
     of the lowest OPTIONS->Multi_Number values of the cost function.

     9.3.70.  OPTIONS->Multi_Grid

          If MULTI_MIN is TRUE, OPTIONS->Multi_Grid must be set by the user
     to  define  the  resolution  permitted  to distinguish among parameter
     values of the best-generated states.  However, this is  overridden  in
     asa.c, to ensure that Multi_Grid is greater or equal to EPS_DOUBLE and

     to OPTIONS->Coarse_Resolution if ASA_RESOLUTION is TRUE.

     9.3.71.  OPTIONS->Multi_Specify

          If MULTI_MIN is TRUE, and if OPTIONS->Multi_Specify is set to  0,
     the  selection of best-generated states includes all sampled instances
     of the cost functions.  If Multi_Specify is set to 1, the selection of
     best-generated  states  is  constrained  to  include  only  those with
     different values of the cost function.

          If Multi_Specify is set to 0, and multiple  best  cost  functions
     are  found, the parameters of the final cost function reported will be
     the parameters of the last best cost  function.   All  new  best  cost
     functions  will  be  reported,  but if ASA_PRINT_MORE is TRUE only new
     lower best cost functions will have additional print out.

          The final values in  asa.c  of  *best_number_generated_saved  and
     *best_number_accepted_saved at the best cost function will be those of
     the first instance of the final best value.  If Multi_Specify  is  set
     to  0,  the  parameters  corresponding  to this final value may not be
     among the set of final  Multi_Params  if  there  are  more  best  cost
     functions than Multi_Number.

          If     ASA_PARALLEL     is    TRUE,    then    N_Generated    and
     *best_number_generated_saved will only be accurate within the scale of
     OPTIONS->Gener_Block, as these are updated in the acceptance function.

     9.3.72.  OPTIONS->Gener_Mov_Avr

          If  ASA_PARALLEL  is  set  to  TRUE, Gener_Mov_Avr determines the
     window of the moving average of sizes  of  parallel  generated  states
     required  to  find  new best accepted states.  A reasonable number for
     many problems is 3.

          If  and  when  OPTIONS->Gener_Mov_Avr   is   set   to   0,   then
     OPTIONS->Gener_Block is not changed thereafter.

     9.3.73.  OPTIONS->Gener_Block

          If  ASA_PARALLEL  is set to TRUE, Gener_Block is an initial block
     size of parallel generated states to calculate how to determine a  new
     best accepted state.

     9.3.74.  OPTIONS->Gener_Block_Max

          If  ASA_PARALLEL  is  set  to TRUE, Gener_Block_Max is an initial
     maximum block size  of  parallel  generated  states  to  calculate  to
     determine a new best accepted state.

          This  can  be useful if your parallel code assigns new processors
     "on the fly," to compensate for some cost  functions  being  more  CPU
     intensive,    e.g.,   due   to   boundary   conditions,   etc.    Then
     OPTIONS->Gener_Block_Max may be larger than  the  number  of  physical
     processors, e.g., if OPTIONS->Gener_Block would call for such a size.

     9.3.75.  OPTIONS->Random_Array_Dim

          When  ASA_SAVE  is set to TRUE, OPTIONS->Random_Array_Dim defines
     the dimension of the array used to hold shuffled random  numbers  used
     by  the  random number generator defined in asa_usr.c.  The default is
     to use SHUFFLE defined in asa_usr.h for Random_Array_Dim.

     9.3.76.  OPTIONS->Random_Array

          When ASA_SAVE is set to  TRUE,  OPTIONS->Random_Array  holds  the
     shuffled random numbers used by the random number generator defined in
     asa_usr.c The default is to  set  the  pointer  of  the  static  array
     random_array at the top of asa_usr.c.

     9.3.77.  OPTIONS->Asa_Recursive_Level

          When using ASA recursively, it often is useful to be able to keep
     track of the level of recursion.

          If ASA_SAVE is set to TRUE, set Asa_Recursive_Level to  be  0  at
     the  most  inner  shell  and increment at each successive outer shell.
     Then, ASA_SAVE will take effect at the most outer recursive shell.

     10.  User Module

     This  module  includes  asa_usr.c,   asa_usr.h,   asa_usr_cst.c,   and
     asa_usr_asa.h.  You may wish to combine them into one file, or you may
     wish to use the ASA module as one component of a library required  for
     a large project.

     10.1.  int main(int argc, char **argv)

          In main (), set up your initializations and calling statements to
     asa.  The files asa_usr.c,  asa_usr.h,  and  asa_usr_cst.c  provide  a
     sample  ()  function,  as  well  as  a  sample  cost function for your
     convenience.  If you do not intend to pass parameters into main,  then
     you  can  just  declare  it  as  main  ()  without  the  argc and argv
     arguments, deleting other references to argc and argv.

          main () returns 0 for a normal exit, -1 if  there  was  a  calloc
     allocation  error  in  asa.c,  or  -2 if there was a calloc allocation
     error in asa_usr.c.

     10.2.  int asa_main(
     #if ASA_TEMPLATE_LIB
               double *main_cost_value,
               double *main_cost_parameters,
               int *main_exit_code
     #endif
               )

          If ASA_LIB is set to TRUE, then asa_main () is used as a function
     call  instead  of  main ().  If SELF_OPTIMIZE is set to TRUE, then the
     first main ()/asa_main () in asa_usr.c is closed off, and a  different

     main ()/asa_main () procedure in asa_usr.c is used.

          asa_main () returns 0 for a normal exit, -1 if there was a calloc
     allocation error in asa.c, or -2 if  there  was  a  calloc  allocation
     error in asa_usr.c.

          If  you  require  parameters  to be passed by asa_main () back to
     your main program,  e.g.,  cost_value,  *cost_parameters,  *exit_code,
     etc.,    then    these    can    be    added    as   *main_cost_value,
     *main_cost_parameters, *main_exit_code, with memory allocated in  your
     own main (), etc.  Such use is illustrated by ASA_TEMPLATE_LIB.

          At  the  end  of  the  asa_usr.c,  part of ASA_TEMPLATE_LIB is an
     example of a main () program that could call asa_main ().

          randflt () calls resettable_randflt  ()  each  time  to  actually
     implement  the  RNG.  This is to provide the capability of getting the
     same runs if the same multiple calls to asa () are  made,  e.g.,  when
     using  ASA_LIB  set to TRUE.  To enforce this, asa_main () should call
     resettable_randflt (rand_seed, 1) at the beginning of each run.

     10.3.  int initialize_parameters(
               double *cost_parameters,
               double *parameter_lower_bound,
               double *parameter_upper_bound,
               double *cost_tangents,
               double *cost_curvature,
               ALLOC_INT *parameter_dimension,
               int *parameter_int_real,

               FILE *ptr_options,
     #endif
               USER_DEFINES * USER_OPTIONS)

          Before calling asa, the user must allocate storage and initialize
     some  of the passed parameters.  A sample () function is provided as a
     template.  In this procedure the user should allocate storage for  the
     passed  arrays  and  define  the minimum and maximum values.  Below is
     detailed all the parameters which must be initialized.  If your arrays
     are  of  size  1,  still use them as arrays as described in asa_usr.c.
     Alternatively, if you define 'int user_flag', then pass &user_flag.

          As written above, these are the names used in  the  user  module.
     All  these  parameters  could  be  passed globally in the user module,
     e.g., by  defining  them  in  asa_usr.h  instead  of  in  main  ()  in
     asa_usr.c,  but  since  the asa module only passes local parameters to
     facilitate recursive use, this approach is taken here as well.

          initialize_parameters () returns 0 for a normal  exit  or  -2  if
     there was a calloc allocation.

          This  procedure  is  used  only  if SELF_OPTIMIZE is TRUE, and is
     constructed      similar      to       initialize_parameters       ().
     recur_initialize_parameters  ()  returns  0 for a normal exit or -2 if

               USER_DEFINES *USER_OPTIONS)


     10.5.1.  cost_function

          You can give any name to cost_function as long as you  pass  this
     name  to  asa;  it  is  called cost_function in the user module.  This
     function returns a real value which ASA will minimize.  In cases where
     it  seems  that  the ASA default parameters are not very efficient for
     your system, you might consider  modifying  the  cost  function  being
     optimized.   For  example, if your actual cost function is of the form
     of an exponential to an exponential, you might  do  better  using  the
     logarithm of this as cost_function.

     10.5.2.  *x

          x  (called  cost_parameters  in  the  user module) is an array of
     doubles representing a set of parameters to evaluate.

     10.5.3.  double *parameter_lower_bound

          See discussion below on parameter_upper_bound.

     10.5.4.  double *parameter_upper_bound

          These two arrays of doubles are passed.  Since ASA works only  on
     bounded  search  spaces,  these  arrays should contain the minimum and
     maximum values each parameter can attain.  If you aren't sure,  try  a
     factor  of  10  or  100  times any reasonable values.  The exponential
     temperature annealing schedule should quickly sharpen the search  down
     to the most important region.

          Passing  the  parameter  bounds in the cost function permits some
     additional adaptive features during the search.  For example,  setting
     the  lower bound equal to the upper bound will remove a parameter from
     consideration for sampling, although it still will be printed out with
     other  parameters  if  OPTIONS  permit.   Whenever this occurs, within
     asa() the effective dimension defining the size of the search space is
     reduced by the number of parameters so removed.

          For  example,  if  your  parameter  constraints are correlated in
     subsets, you can implement the following in your cost_function  ()  in
     asa_usr.c  or  asa_usr_cst.c.  Immediately upon entering cost_function
     () after receiving a full set of new parameters from asa (), check all
     correlated subsets of points.  If some correlated subset is not valid,
     for  all  parameters  that   do   satisfy   your   constraints,   save
     parameter_lower_bound   []   and   parameter_upper_bound  []  in  some
     temporary   arrays,   set   parameter_lower_bound    []    equal    to
     parameter_upper_bound  [],  *cost_flag  equal  to FALSE, and return to
     asa ().  Have asa () keep recalculating  the  new  subsets  of  points
     until all subsets are valid.  Then, reset parameter_lower_bound [] and
     parameter_upper_bound [] from the temporary arrays,  and  continue  on
     with  the rest of cost_function ().  You may wish to perform this with
     the Quenching OPTIONS turned on, so  that  you  also  can  accordingly
     adaptively  modify  the annealing rates using the new effective number
     of active parameters.

     10.5.5.  double *cost_tangents

          This array of  doubles  is  passed.   On  return  from  asa  this
     contains  the  first  derivatives of the cost function with respect to
     its parameters.  These can be useful for determining the value of your
     fit.   In  the default implementation of ASA, the tangents are used to
     determine the relative reannealing among parameters.

     10.5.6.  double *cost_curvature

          This array of doubles is passed next.  On return  from  asa,  for
     real  parameters,  this  contains  the  second derivatives of the cost
     function with respect to its parameters.  These also can be useful for
     determining  the value of your fit, e.g., as a "covariance matrix" for
     the fitted parameters.

          When the DEFINE_OPTIONS Curvature_0 option is  set  to  TRUE  the
     curvature  calculations  are  bypassed.   This  can be useful for very
     large spaces.

     10.5.7.  ALLOC_INT *parameter_dimension

          An integer containing the dimensionality of the  state  space  is
     passed   next.    The   arrays   x   (representing   cost_parameters),
     parameter_lower_bound,   parameter_upper_bound,   cost_tangents,   and
     parameter_int_real  (below)  are to be of the size *number_parameters.
     The  array  curvature  which  may   be   of   size   the   square   of
     *number_parameters.

          Setting  the  lower  bound equal to the upper bound will remove a
     parameter from consideration.  Whenever this occurs, within asa()  the
     effective  dimension  defining the size of the search space is reduced
     by the number of parameters so removed.

     10.5.8.  int *parameter_int_real

          This integer array is passed next.  Each element  of  this  array
     (each  flag)  can  be:   REAL_TYPE (-1) (indicating the parameter is a
     real value), INTEGER_TYPE (1) (indicating the parameter  can  take  on
     only  integer  values),  REAL_NO_REANNEAL (-2), or INTEGER_NO_REANNEAL
     (2).  The latter two choices signify that no  derivatives  are  to  be
     taken  with  respect  to  these parameters.  (Derivatives can be taken
     with INTEGER_TYPE (1) only if  OPTIONS->Include_Integer_Parameters  is
     set to TRUE.) For example, this can be useful to exclude discontinuous
     functions  from  being  reannealed.   Note  that  the  values  of  the
     parameters  and their ranges are always passed as doubles in the code,
     but their values will be  integral  for  those  parameters  which  are
     defined as INTEGER_TYPE or INTEGER_NO_REANNEAL.

          If  a  system  parameter  is  discrete,  but  not a simple set of
     sequential  integers,  then  it  may  be   necessary   to   define   a
     transformation  within  the  cost function in terms of a new parameter
     which is a set of sequential integers.  Also note that  ASA_RESOLUTION
     may   be  used  in  some  such  cases,  which  overrides  the  use  of
     parameter_int_real.  Then, this new parameter, instead of the original
     discrete parameter, can be passed between asa () and the cost_function
     ().  The (approximate) range of  the  transformed  parameter  must  be
     reflected  in  the  values  assigned  to  parameter_lower_bound [] and
     parameter_upper_bound  [],  as  discussed  above.   Of  course,   this
     transformation may be supplemented by constraints that can be enforced
     using the *cost_flag in the user module, as discussed below.

     10.5.9.  *cost_flag

          cost_flag is the address of an  integer.   In  cost_function  (),
     *cost_flag  should be set to FALSE (0) if the parameters violate a set
     of user defined constraints (e.g., as defined by  a  set  of  boundary
     conditions) or TRUE (1) if the parameters represent a valid state.  If
     *cost_flag is returned to asa () as FALSE, no acceptance test will  be
     attempted, and a new set of trial parameters will be generated.

          If  another algorithm suggests a way of incorporating constraints
     into the cost function, then this modified cost function can  be  used
     as well by ASA, or that algorithm might best be used as a front-end to

     ASA.

          If OPTIONS->User_Tangents [FALSE] has  been  set  to  TRUE,  then
     asa ()     expects     the    user    to    test    the    value    of
     *valid_state_generated_flag that enters from  asa ().   If  *cost_flag
     enters  with a value of -1, then the user is expected to calculate the
     cost_tangents [] array before exiting that  particular  evaluation  of
     the    cost    function.     An   example   is   provided   with   the
     ASA_TEMPLATE_SAMPLE example.

          When ASA_QUEUE is TRUE, then the value of  *cost_flag  is  tested
     for  FALSE  in  previous  states  in queue and an invalid statement is
     available in the printout.

     10.5.10.  int *exit_code

          The address of this integer is  passed  to  asa.   On  return  it
     contains  the code for the reason asa exited.  When ASA_PRINT is TRUE,
     the value is printed out.

          NORMAL_EXIT = 0.  Given the  criteria  set  largely  by  the
          DEFINE_OPTIONS,  the search has run its normal course, e.g.,
          when Limit_Acceptances or Limit_Generated is reached.

          P_TEMP_TOO_SMALL = 1.  A parameter temperature was too small
          using  the set criteria.  Often this is an acceptable status
          code.  You can omit this test by setting  NO_PARAM_TEMP_TEST
          to  TRUE  as one of your Pre-Compile Options; then values of
          the parameter temperatures less than EPS_DOUBLE are  set  to
          EPS_DOUBLE.

          C_TEMP_TOO_SMALL  =  2.   The cost temperature was too small
          using the set criteria.  Often this is an acceptable  status
          code.   You  can omit this test by setting NO_COST_TEMP_TEST
          to TRUE as one of your Pre-Compile Options; then a value  of
          the   cost  temperature  less  than  EPS_DOUBLE  is  set  to
          EPS_DOUBLE.

          COST_REPEATING = 3.  The  cost  function  value  repeated  a
          number  of  times  using the set criteria.  Often this is an
          acceptable status code.

          TOO_MANY_INVALID_STATES = 4.  Too many repetitive  generated
          states were invalid using the set criteria.  This is helpful
          when  using  *cost_flag,  as  discussed  above,  to  include
          constraints.

          IMMEDIATE_EXIT     =     5.      The     user     has    set
          OPTIONS->Immediate_Exit   to   TRUE,   or    deleted    file
          asa_exit_anytime when ASA_EXIT_ANYTIME is TRUE.

          INVALID_USER_INPUT  =  7.   The  user has introduced invalid
          input.      When     entering     asa (),     a     function
          asa_test_asa_options   ()   checks   out  many  user-defined

          parameters and OPTIONS, and prints out invalid OPTIONS  when
          ASA_PRINT is set to TRUE.

          INVALID_COST_FUNCTION = 8.  The user has returned a value of
          the cost function to asa () which is  not  a  valid  number,
          e.g.,  not between -MAX_DOUBLE and MAX_DOUBLE.  Or, the user
          has returned a value of a parameter  no  longer  within  its
          proper  range  (excluding  cases  where the user has set the
          lower bound equal to the upper bound to remove  a  parameter
          from consideration).

          INVALID_COST_FUNCTION_DERIV    =   9.    While   calculating
          numerical cost derivatives, a value of the cost function was
          returned  which  is  not  a  valid number, e.g., not between
          -MAX_DOUBLE and MAX_DOUBLE.  Or, while calculating numerical
          cost  derivatives,  a  value of a parameter no longer within
          its proper range (excluding cases where the user has set the
          lower  bound  equal to the upper bound to remove a parameter
          from consideration) was set.   In  such  cases,  review  the
          bounds  of  parameters and the OPTIONS used to determine how
          derivatives are calculated and used.

               When calculating derivatives, an invalid cost function,
          i.e.,  returning  *cost_flag = FALSE from the cost function,
          will exit asa() with *exit_code INVALID_COST_FUNCTION_DERIV.
          Also,   when  calculating  derivatives,  no  extra  test  is
          performed to check that parameters are  within  their  lower
          and  upper  bounds  (since meshes for derivatives may exceed
          these bounds).  If this is not desired, then within the cost
          function,  within a test for USER_OPTIONS->Locate_Cost == 3,
          a decision may be made whether to return this *exit_code.

          CALLOC_FAILED = -1.  Calloc memory allocation has failed  in
          asa.c.   This  error will call Exit_ASA(), the location will
          be printed to stdout, and asa () will return  the double  -1
          to  the  calling  program.   In asa_usr.c, if asa () returns
          this *exit_code a warning will be printed both to stdout and
          to  USER_OUT.  Note that if a calloc memory allocation fails
          in asa_usr.c, this error will call Exit_USER() to print  the
          location to stdout and then return -2.

          Note  that  just  relying  on  such  a  simple  summary  given by
     *exit_status  can  be  extremely  deceptive,  especially   in   highly
     nonlinear  problems.   It  is  strongly  suggested  that  the user set
     ASA_PRINT=TRUE before any production runs.   An  examination  of  some
     periodic output of ASA can be essential to its proper use.

     10.5.11.  USER_DEFINES *OPTIONS

          All Program Options are defined in this structure.  Since Program
     Options are passed to asa and the cost function, these may be  changed
     adaptively.

          The  Program  Options  also  can  be read in from a separate data
     file,  asa_opt,  permitting  efficient   tuning/debugging   of   these
     parameters without having to recompile the code.  This option has been
     added to the asa module.

     10.6.  double recur_cost_function(
               double *recur_cost_parameters,
               double *recur_parameter_lower_bound,
               double *recur_parameter_upper_bound,

               int *recur_exit_code,
               USER_DEFINES * RECUR_USER_OPTIONS)

          This procedure is used only if  SELF_OPTIMIZE  is  TRUE,  and  is
     constructed similar to cost_function ().

     10.7.  double user_random_generator(
               LONG_INT *rand_seed)

          A  random  number generator function must be selected.  It may be
     as simple as  one  of  the  UNIX(R)  random  number  generators  (e.g.
     drand48),  or  may  be user defined, but it should return a real value
     within [0,1) and not  take  any  parameters.   A  good  random  number
     generator,   randflt,   and   its  auxiliary  routines,  including  an
     alternative RNG, are provided with the code in the user module.

          The random seed, first defined in the user module, is  passed  to
     asa (),  where  it  can  be  reset.   This  can  be  useful  for  some
     parallelization algorithms.

          Most random number generators should be "warmed-up" by calling  a
     set  of  dummy  random numbers.  Here, randflt () does this when it is
     first called, or when it is fed a negative random seed (which can be a
     useful flag for asa_seed () below).

          randflt  ()  calls  resettable_randflt  ()  each time to actually
     implement the RNG.  This is to provide the capability of  getting  the
     same  runs  if  the same multiple calls to asa () are made, e.g., when
     using ASA_LIB set to TRUE.  To enforce this, asa_main ()  should  call
     resettable_randflt (rand_seed, 1) at the beginning of each run.

     10.8.  LONG_INT asa_seed(
               LONG_INT seed)

          When  ASA_LIB is set to TRUE asa_seed () becomes available to set
     the initial random seed.  This can be useful  for  repeated  calls  to
     asa_main  ()  described  above.   If an absolute value of seed greater
     than 0 is given to a call of  asa_seed,  then  seed  is  used  as  the
     initial  random seed; otherwise asa_main () will by default create its
     own random seed, and the user need not be concerned with any  call  to

     asa_seed  ().  An example of use is given when ASA_TEMPLATE_LIB is set
     to true.

          If the value of seed is less than 0,  this  signals  the  default
     randflt  ()  to initialize the array of seeds to be shuffled.  This is
     especially useful when  using  repeated  calls  to  asa_main  ()  when
     ASA_LIB is TRUE.

     10.9.  double user_cost_schedule(
               double test_temperature,
               const void *OPTIONS_TMP)

          If  USER_COST_SCHEDULE [FALSE] is set to TRUE, then this function
     must define how the new cost  temperature  is  calculated  during  the
     acceptance  test.   The  default  is  to return test_temperature.  For
     example, if you sense that the search is spending  too  much  time  in
     local  minima  at some stage of search, e.g., dependent on information
     gathered in USER_OPTIONS, then you might return  the  square  root  of
     test_temperature,  or some other function, to slow down the sharpening
     of the cost function acceptance test.

     10.10.  double recur_user_cost_schedule(
               double test_temperature,
               const void *OPTIONS_TMP)

          If USER_COST_SCHEDULE [FALSE] and SELF_OPTIMIZE [FALSE] both  are
     set  to  TRUE,  then  this  function  must  define  how  the  new cost
     temperature is calculated during the acceptance  test.   As  discussed
     above  for  user_cost_schedule (), you may modify the default value of
     test_temperature  returned  by  this  function,  e.g.,  dependent   on
     information gathered in RECUR_USER_OPTIONS.

     10.11.  void user_acceptance_test(
               double *uniform_test,
               double current_cost,
               double *parameter_lower_bound,
               double *parameter_upper_bound,
               ALLOC_INT *number_parameters,
               const void *OPTIONS_TMP)

          If  USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST  [FALSE]  is  set  to  TRUE,  then  this
     function must determine the acceptance test, e.g., as an alternate  to
     the  Boltzmann test.  USER_ACCEPT_ASYMP_EXP [FALSE] is an example of a
     class of such modifications.

     10.12.  void recur_user_acceptance_test(

          If USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST [FALSE] and  SELF_OPTIMIZE  [FALSE]  both
     are  set  to  TRUE,  then  this function must determine the acceptance
     test, e.g., as an alternate to the Boltzmann test.

     10.13.  double user_generating_distrib(
               LONG_INT *seed,

               double *last_saved_parameter,
               const void *OPTIONS_TMP)

          If USER_GENERATING_FUNCTION [FALSE] is set  to  TRUE,  then  this
     function  (referred  by  USER_OPTIONS->Generating_Distrib  in the user
     module)  must  define  the  probability  distribution   (or   whatever
     algorithm  is  required) to use for generating new states, e.g., as an
     alternate to the ASA distribution.

          Even mild modifications to the ASA distribution  can  be  useful,
     e.g.,  slowing down the annealing schedule by taking a fractional root
     of the current temperature.

          The passed array last_saved_parameter [] contains  all  the  last
     saved   parameters,   which  are  sometimes  required  for  algorithms
     requiring decisions based on all current parameters.  This permits the
     use  of  the  ASA  code  for heuristic algorithms that may violate its
     sampling proof, but nevertheless are useful to  process  some  complex
     systems within a SA framework.

          If  USER_GENERATING_FUNCTION  [FALSE]  and  SELF_OPTIMIZE [FALSE]
     both  are   set   to   TRUE,   then   this   function   (referred   by
     RECUR_USER_OPTIONS->Generating_Distrib in the user module) must define
     the probability distribution (or whatever algorithm  is  required)  to
     use  for  generating  new  states,  e.g.,  as  an alternate to the ASA
     distribution.

               cost_function,

               cost_flag,
               exit_code,
               USER_OPTIONS)

          This  is the form of the call to asa from asa_usr.c.  A double is
     returned to the calling program as whatever it is named by  the  user,
     e.g., final_cost.  It will be the minimum cost value found by asa.

     10.20.  double asa(
               double (*user_cost_function) (
                    double *, double *, double *, double *, double *,
                    ALLOC_INT *, int *, int *, int *, USER_DEFINES *),
               double (*user_random_generator) (LONG_INT *),
               LONG_INT *rand_seed,
               double *parameter_initial_final,
               double *parameter_minimum,
               double *parameter_maximum,
               double *tangents,
               double *curvature,
               ALLOC_INT *number_parameters,
               int *parameter_type,
               int *valid_state_generated_flag,
               int *exit_status,
               USER_DEFINES * OPTIONS)

          This  is how asa is defined in the ASA module, contained in asa.c
     and    asa_usr_asa.h.      All     but     the     user_cost_function,
     user_random_generator,  and  parameter_initial_final  parameters  have
     been described above as they also are passed by user_cost_function ().

     10.20.1.  double (*user_cost_function) ()

          The parameter (*user_cost_function*) () is a pointer to the  cost
     function that you defined in your user module.

     10.20.2.  double (*user_random_generator) ()

          A pointer to the random number generator function, defined in the
     user module, must be passed next.

     Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)                       Lester Ingber


     10.20.3.  LONG_INT *rand_seed

          A pointer to the random seed, defined in the user module, must be
     passed next.

     10.20.4.  double *parameter_initial_final

          An  array  of doubles is passed (passed as cost_parameters in the
     user module).   Initially,  this  array  holds  the  set  of  starting
     parameters   which   should   satisfy   any  constraints  or  boundary
     conditions.  Upon return  from  the  asa  procedure,  the  array  will
     contain the best set of parameters found by asa to minimize the user's
     cost  function.   Experience  shows  that  any  guesses   within   the
     acceptable  ranges  should suffice, since initially the system is at a
     high annealing temperature and ASA samples the breadth of the  ranges.
     The  default  is  to  have  asa  generate  a set of initial parameters
     satisfying the user's  constraints.   This  can  be  overridden  using
     User_Initial_Parameters=TRUE,  to have the user's initial guess be the
     first generated set of parameters.

     10.21.  void print_time(char *message, FILE * ptr_out)

          As  a  convenience,  this  subroutine  and  its auxiliary routine
     aux_print_time are provided in asa.c to keep track of the  time  spent
     during  optimization.  Templates in the code are provided to use these
     routines to print to output from both the asa and user modules.  These
     routines can give some compilation problems on some platforms, and may
     be bypassed  using  one  of  the  DEFINE_OPTIONS.   It  takes  as  its
     parameters  a  string which will be printed and the pointer to file to
     where  the  printout  is   directed.    An   example   is   given   in
     user_cost_function   to   illustrate  how  print_time  may  be  called
     periodically every set number of calls by  using  PRINT_FREQUENCY  and
     RECUR_PRINT_FREQUENCY  in  asa_usr.c.   See  the  ASA-NOTES  file  for
     changes in these routines that may  be  required  on  some  particular
     systems.

     10.22.  void sample(FILE * ptr_out, FILE * ptr_asa)

          When  ASA_TEMPLATE_SAMPLE is set to TRUE, using data collected in
     the ASA_OUT file, this routine illustrates how  to  extract  the  data
     stored in the ASA_OUT file and print it to the user module.

     10.23.  void adaptive_options(USER_DEFINES * USER_OPTIONS)

          When ADAPTIVE_OPTIONS is set to TRUE, it is  possible  to  change
     relevant  OPTIONS  in  the USER_DEFINES struct in asa_usr_asa.h during
     run time, by including an asa_adaptive_options file.  This can be very
     useful to efficiently determine how to tune long runs.

          The  function  call  to  adaptive_options(USER_OPTIONS) should be
     placed at the top of your cost function.  Some examples of the  format
     of  lines  in  the comma-delimited asa_adaptive_options file are given
     just above the adaptive_options function in asa_usr.c.

     11.  Bug Reports and Help With ASA

     Please read this ASA-README.[] file  and  the  ASA-NOTES  file  before
     seeking help or reporting bugs.

          I  make every reasonable effort to maintain only current versions
     of the asa module, to permit the code to compile without "error,"  not
     necessarily  without  compiler  "warnings." The user module is offered
     only as a guide to accessing the asa module.  The ASA-NOTES file  will
     contain  updates  for  some  standard  machines.   I  welcome your bug
     reports and constructive critiques regarding this code.

          Without seeing any specific output from your system, of course  I
     can't  say anything specific.  While I cannot promise that I can spend
     the time to join your quest to the very end  to  insure  you  get  the
     global optimal point for your system, I can state that I will at least
     get back to you after seeing some print out.  Many times, it is useful
     to  add ASA_PRINT_MORE=TRUE to your compile DEFINE_OPTIONS to get more
     info, and enclose relevant portions your ASA_OUT file with your query.
     (See the section Use of Documentation for Tuning above.)

          My  policy,  as  stated  in the ASA-NOTES file, is to keep all my
     help as well as my commercial work with ASA on a  confidential  basis.
     I  do  not  divulge  any names of people or information about (legal!)
     projects unless I am given specific permission to do so or unless  the
     work  is  published.   This  policy  promotes  feedback  on  ASA which
     benefits all users as well as those individuals seeking help.

          "Flames" will be rapidly quenched.
